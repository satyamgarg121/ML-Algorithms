I hope to show that there\\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\\n\\n\\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\\n\\n\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \\nKellner\\'s efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\\nin Reuss\\'s Masonic publication, \\'Oriflamme\\'.  On Kellner\\'s death,\\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The \\'Jubilee\\' edition of\\nthe \\'Oriflamme\\', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\\nsecret of sexual magic.\\n \\n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\\nLeague founded by Karl Marx\\'s daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\\n\\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss\\' leadership.\\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\\n\\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss\\'s request, deeply\\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\\n\\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX\\'\\n\\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \\n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\\nfor very many interpretations.\\n\\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\\nsupport of the \\'Law of Thelema\\' is laughable at best.\\n\\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \\nWill I?  \\nI think not.\\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\\n\\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X\\'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\\nI do not support Reuss\\'s words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\\nthe Order has \\'gone soft\\' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\\n\\n\\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \\nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\\nof the organization as it stands.\\n\\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \\nI followed my intuition, and I\\'ve found little to stop me from requesting\\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I\\'m happily participating\\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\\nMass well enough for my tastes.\\n \\n\\nThis doesn\\'t make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\\nlimited contact with other members.\\n\\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\\nand the preservation of individual vision.\\n\\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\\nto other posts in this thread.\\n\\n\\nInvoke me under my stars.  Love is the law, love under will.\\n\\nI am I!\\n\\nFrater (I) Nigris (DCLXVI) CCCXXXIII\\n',\n",

They don't use their\\nsize *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team\\nchasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.\\n\\n>Calgary vs. Los Angeles:\\n>This would have been tough to call, except for three things. 1/ The\\n>Kings don't have a goalie; 2/ Gary Roberts will be back; 3/ the Kings\\n>shot themselves in the foot by trading a proven winner (Paul Coffey)\\n>for a proven loser (Jimmy Carson).

LA in six.\\n\\n>FINAL:\\n>Vancouver vs. Calgary:\\n> FLAMES IN 6.\\n\\nIf it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.

Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than\\nGilmour.  NO WAY.

But while\\nhe and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge),\\nGilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp.\\nfrom Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud\\nyour judgement when it comes to his skill.

What happens is that after a certain variable interval of time\\nthe video circuitry \\'loses\\' vertical sync. It is quite apparent that the\\nMac CPU is still ok, and the problem really seems to lie with the video\\ncircuitry, since you can still save your documents, quit your aplpications,\\neven pull down menus etc. (only the display is scrolling lik crazy, so it\\'s\\npretty hard to hit menu items ;-)\\nWe had the original logic board replaced twice now, and the same problem\\nhas been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has\\nvaried. The first board had this problem every about 1hr, more often if the\\ncache was turned OFF (yes OFF).  This is the only symptom that is not\\nobviously related to the video circuitry (after all the cache is on the CPU\\nright?). The second board had the problem every about 10 minutes (we did\\nnot keep it, rather we put the original back), the current board we have\\nhas this problem a lot less often (has gone about a week without doing it,\\nbut did it twice within an hour yesterday).\\nThe technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty\\nsharp and tried a number of sensible things (most of which we had\\npreviously tried ourselves anyway). These included:\\n-swapping the RAM\\n-swapping the VRAM\\n-swapping monitors (3 different 13\" Apple RGB and 2 16\" Apple RGB)\\n-swapping cables\\n-disconnecting HD and booting from floppy\\n-sacrificing various small mammals\\nHere are some other facts:\\n-when we put a RasterOps ProColor 32 on the NuBus, the problem is fixed\\n (it does not occur with the internal video or the ProColor video out)\\n-the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards\\n that exhibit it in our lab\\n-Apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards\\n that they cannot find anything wrong with, and getting them shipped back as\\n faulty according to us.\\nHere are some speculations:\\n-I bet that neither Apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that\\n much RAM and VRAM on them simultaneaously, which may have something to do\\n with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem (though we can\\n reproduce it with just 4Mb of RAM, so this is probably a red herring).\\n-the vendor\\'s representative blames \\'metal in your walls\\' - claims that our\\n walls have metal in them which interferes with the Mac\\'s operation. We\\n have another 950 in the lab which works like a charm (though it\\'s not in\\n the exact same spot....) Please don\\'t tell me this is probably it, I do\\n not want to believe it.\\n-it\\'s probably not poltergeists, since they do not have badges to get past\\n security at the entrance to our site.\\n\\nHas anyone any ideas?

At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption\\nchip called the \"Clipper Chip\" together with a split-key approach to\\nescrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from\\nboth are needed to reconstruct a key.\\n\\n\\nCHIP CONTENTS\\n\\nThe Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block\\nencryption algorithm called \"Skipjack.\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys\\n(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling\\n(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of\\noperation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic\\nCodebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.\\n\\nEach chip includes the following components:\\n\\n   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\\n   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\\n   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)\\n   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\\n\\nThe chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the\\n\"MYK-78.\"  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are\\nimplemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about\\n$30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the\\ntechnology is shrunk to .8 micron.\\n\\n\\nENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\\n\\nTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\\ntelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\\nwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\\nconversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K\\nwith the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place\\nwithout the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can\\nbe used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.\\n\\nOnce the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to\\nencrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The\\ntelephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two\\nvalues:\\n\\n   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \\n   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , \\n\\nwhich are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement\\nfield thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U\\nconcatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family\\nkey F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after\\nan authorized wiretap has been installed.\\n\\nThe ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver\\'s device using the\\nsession key:\\n\\n   D[E[M; K]; K] = M .\\n\\n\\nCHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW\\n\\nAll Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented\\nInformation Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains\\na laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips\\nare programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at\\nMykotronx.\\n\\nAt the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key\\nescrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random\\n80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random\\n80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit\\nkeys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a\\nfunction of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.\\n  \\nTo generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\\nfirst padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\\nS1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\\n64-bit block R1:\\n\\n        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\nSimilarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\\nN3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \\n\\n        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \\n        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\nR1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\\nfirst 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\\nrest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\\nare the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\\nagencies.\\n\\nAs a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\\nwritten onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\\nfile for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\\nU1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\\ndisk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\\n2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing\\nan 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not\\nknow the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit\\nkey parts.  \\n\\nThe third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are\\nprogrammed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents\\nleave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no\\ninformation is left behind.\\n \\nThe protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\\nroom instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\\nand the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\\nthe escrow agencies. \\n\\nThe escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not\\nbe the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or\\nboth may be independent from the government.\\n\\n\\nLAW ENFORCEMENT USE\\n\\nWhen law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they\\nwill first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get\\naccess to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in\\nplace and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the\\nClipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the\\nfamily key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap\\nhas been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is\\nthen sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who\\nreturn (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed\\ntogether to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the\\nsession key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will\\nbe accomplished through a special black box decoder.\\n\\n\\nCAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION\\n\\nA successor to the Clipper Chip, called \"Capstone\" by the government\\nand \"MYK-80\" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include\\nthe Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the\\nSecure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast\\nexponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for\\ntesting on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for\\ndelivery in June or July.\\n\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE.

[1]\\n\\nBorn 1964\\nSecretary-Typist\\nAzsantekmontazh Trust\\nSumgait Construction and Installation Administration\\nSecretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization\\n\\nResident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15\\nMicrodistrict No. 3\\nSumgait [Azerbaijan]\\n\\n\\nOn the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o\\'clock show,\\nat the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards \\naway. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \"The Abyss.\" \\nBefore the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at \\nthe City Party Committee, but they were silent, there\\'s no conversation \\nwhatsoever, and we couldn\\'t figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it \\nwas about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if \\nsomeone gave a speech or not, we didn\\'t know. We bought our tickets. There \\nwere 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that \\nlarge movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the\\nfilm. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well \\nmostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an \\nArmenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that \\nthey were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do \\nto Armenian girls. I thought that\\'s what they meant because they had demanded \\na girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move \\nover, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone \\nrecognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. \\nIt got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it\\'s\\nonly opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. \\nEveryone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, \\npeople of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the \\nauditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and \\ngradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \"OK, we\\'ve \\nscared them enough, let\\'s leave.\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to \\nme that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of \\n\"anasha\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like \\nthey were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing \\nhad happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful \\nfilms which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We \\ncould barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, \\nand it was dark . . .\\n\\nMarina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that\\'s the center of town. Lenin\\nStreet was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, \\nsomething about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren\\'t especially \\nlistening, because the way we were feeling we didn\\'t know if we were going to \\nmake it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation \\nwasn\\'t running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, \\npolicemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the\\ndoors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors \\nthere are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-\\nstricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some \\nnaughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, \\nsince he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super \\nserious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we \\nlive literally one stop away. We didn\\'t want to go on foot, not because it was\\ndark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the \\ndriver didn\\'t want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and \\nhe said he\\'d take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, \\nOK . . .\\n\\nSo we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was \\nhappening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation \\nwas at a standstill and everyone was shouting \"Ka-ra-bagh,\" they\\'re not going \\nto give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what\\'s going on, and there\\'s\\nimmediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had \\ncome, they were going to come, kill us, that\\'s it . . . Somehow we managed to \\ncheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,\\njust what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma \\ndown. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though \\nnothing had happened.\\n\\nThat was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn\\'t go anywhere and \\ndidn\\'t call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.\\nThat day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn\\'t\\nguess.\\n\\nOn the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always\\nhad. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, \\nMarina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and \\nno one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that \\nmorning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at\\nhome and didn\\'t know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda \\nZimogliad, came by at around three o\\'clock I think. We worked together, we did\\nour apprenticeships together, she\\'s a Russian girl. She said that something\\nawful was happening in town. I asked, \"Don\\'t they want Armenians? Well what \\nare they after, if they\\'re already in that state?\" She says, no, nothing like \\nthat, it\\'s just a demonstration, but it\\'s awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels\\nlike a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The \\ncabs, the buses, well it\\'s just a nightmare.\\n\\nThen Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy \\nproblems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,\\nasked him, \"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going\\non in the courtyard; aren\\'t you afraid to go out?\" Papa didn\\'t know what she\\nwas talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home \\nand told Mamma. Mamma said, \"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means\\nthat something is really going on.\" But we didn\\'t go see her, she\\'s a Russian,\\nshe lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o\\'clock I \\ntell Lyuda, \"Ok, look, it\\'s time for you to go, it\\'s late already, I\\'ll see \\nyou out.\" Mamma says, \"You don\\'t need to go, it\\'s too late already, you can \\nsee what the situation in town is.\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was \\nready. Mamma says, \"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\" We sat down at the \\ntable. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything \\nout on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we\\'re eating.\\nWe turned on the television, and the show \"In Fairy-Tale Land\" was coming on. \\nWe cleared the table.\\n\\nWe hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can\\'t \\nsee what\\'s going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus\\nstation, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people \\n. . . I can\\'t figure out what\\'s happening. They\\'re shouting something, looking\\nsomewhere, I can\\'t make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she\\'s \\nan Azerbaijani; we\\'ve been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down\\nto look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story \\nbuildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 \\npeople, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see \\nseveral people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide\\nthat means it\\'s not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they\\'re not \\nkilling anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of \\nthe soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their \\nfeet, everyone\\'s kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in \\ngeneral terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can\\'t speak\\n. . . Well, they\\'ve probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .\\nIf each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him\\nand started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn\\'t see if he\\ngot up and left or not.\\n\\nI become terrified and go home and say, \"Lyuda, don\\'t go anywhere, stay at our\\nplace, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \" Then the crowd \\nruns over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and \\nstarts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors \\nare also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is \\nshouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it \\nturns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and \\nkept them from coming in. There\\'s only one entryway there, they could stop \\nthem.\\n\\nThey all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,\\nafraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the \\nwindows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, \\nand it\\'s packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don\\'t \\ncrush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It\\'s just a huge\\ncloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey \\nSargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear \\ntramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous \\ndin and roar. It\\'s incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were \\nshouting Father\\'s name, \"Grisha, open the door, we\\'ve come to kill you!,\" or\\nsomething like that. I don\\'t remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma \\nsays, \"Into the bedroom, quickly!\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part \\nof our dowry; Mamma says, \"Hide there, they probably won\\'t come in there, \\nthey\\'ll ask something, say something, and leave.\" She says, \"We\\'ll tell them \\nthat we live alone here.\" I can\\'t imagine that my parents will stand out in \\nthe hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say \\nthat I\\'ll stand together with them, I\\'ll talk with them if they come, maybe I \\ncan find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak \\nAzerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and\\nLyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can\\'t remember if I told \\nher anything or not.\\n\\nThen . . . they open the door: it\\'s like they blew on it and it broke and fell\\nright into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,\\nleave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I\\ntell them, \"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what\\nhas happened.\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \"Get out of the apartment, leave.\" I \\nsay, \"OK. Go downstairs. We\\'ll gather everything we need and leave the \\napartment.\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with\\nthem, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the\\ndoorway, the young guys, say, \"There are old people and one girl with them.\\nToo bad!\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have\\npacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, \\ncommanding them: \"Don\\'t you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\"\\n\\nAnd that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one\\nroom, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start \\nundressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, \\nin front of Mamma. I don\\'t remember where they went, what they did, or how \\nmuch time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,\\nand tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don\\'t even know what I said. The \\natrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among \\nthemselves who would go first.\\n\\nLater, I remember, I came to. I don\\'t know if I\\'m dead or alive. Someone comes\\nin, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. \\nHe looks around at what\\'s happening. At that instant everything stops. It \\nseems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything\\ndepends on him. He looks and says, \"Well, we\\'re done here.\" They are beating\\nMamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs \\n. . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she\\'s dead. Papa . . . was\\nout cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can\\'t get the \\nwindow open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the \\nwindows can\\'t be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking \\nabout being thrown out the window and passed out. She\\'s not a real strong \\nperson anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I\\'m saying something, that\\nI\\'m still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, \\nwhich is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they \\ndon\\'t get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I\\'m dead, why would I \\nhumble myself before anyone? And he says that if that\\'s what I think, since my\\ntongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing \\n. . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.\\n\\nI no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don\\'t \\nknow if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by \\nmy arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, \\nsomething metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone\\nelse is pinching me . . .I don\\'t even know. I think, my God, when will death \\ncome? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near\\nthe entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What \\nhappened after that, how many people there were, I don\\'t remember.\\n \\nI come to after a while, I don\\'t remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me \\nclothing. I\\'m entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember \\nthat I said the same words over and over again: \"Mamma, what happened, Mamma, \\nwhat have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\" I can\\'t make \\nsense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he\\nserved in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all \\nwent to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his \\ncourage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors\\', even though \\nhe\\'s small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he \\nserved in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served\\nthere, I think; now he\\'s stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor \\nbrought me to the neighbors\\', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, \\n\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I\\'m not one of them.\" How do I know who\\'s who \\nand what\\'s what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then\\nPapa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when \\nthey dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda \\nsaid that she was Russian, they said, we\\'ll let you go, we aren\\'t touching the\\nRussians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she\\'s going \\nto tell them she\\'s Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina\\'s and Lyuda\\'s \\nhands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our \\nsister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor\\'s and starts pounding \\non the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in \\nthere. So they survived.\\n\\nMy sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.\\nWhile they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back \\nup again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed \\nthere. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put \\nit on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor\\'s on the fourth floor, the\\none whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and \\nknocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \"I\\'m not going to let you \\nin the apartment because I\\'m afraid of them. But I\\'ll give you some stockings \\nand we\\'ll leave the building.\" Lyuda says, \"I\\'ll stay at your place because of\\nwhat\\'s going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\" It was just for a \\nmoment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn\\'t consent. Lyuda came \\nback to our place and lay under the bed . . .\\n\\nI came to. Mother was there. I can\\'t remember my supervisor\\'s telephone \\nnumber, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he \\ncame to get us. He didn\\'t have any idea what was going on. He thought we were \\nsimply afraid, he didn\\'t know that they were killing us and that we had passed\\nbetween life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.\\nThere they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, \\nit was hard to breathe . . .\\n\\nMy supervisor\\'s name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He\\'s the head of our \\nadministration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number\\nof buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary \\npassenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right \\nafter eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a \\ngreat many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and\\nwhat was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not \\nonly in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, \\nwithout stopping. After us.\\n\\nI think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from\\nBuildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died\\nfrom Building 16, that\\'s the building in front of ours. There young \\nAzerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn\\'t let it into their building. \\nIncidentally, when we were at the neighbors\\', Marina called our relatives\\nto warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in \\nMicrodistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \"Run\\nquickly, I can\\'t explain what\\'s going on; hide, do what you can, just stay\\nalive. Hide at Azerbaijanis\\', ones who won\\'t give you away.\" At that moment \\nthree people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such\\nawful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, \\nthere was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything \\nout of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face\\nwas pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my\\nnormal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to \\nscream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you \\nhere, haven\\'t you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of \\nthe soldiers said, \"Don\\'t scream at us. We\\'re Muslims, but we\\'re not from the \\nSumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\" So at that point the \\nDaghestan police were there.\\n\\nWhen we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,\\nthere were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don\\'t know,\\nmaybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously \\ninjured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don\\'t know what they \\nwere there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda \\nand me and said, \"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don\\'t \\nknow what to do with the rest.\"\\n\\nSo they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My \\nboss said, \"Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll find you, no matter where you are, no matter\\nwhat happens.\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department\\nhead from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She \\nexamined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait \\nambulances hadn\\'t done anything, they didn\\'t respond to any calls. People \\ncalled and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.\\n\\nThat doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something\\nvery good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, \\n\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\" She looks me over and \\nsays, \"Now why are you suffering so? You don\\'t know what your people have been\\ndoing, your people did even worse things.\" And I think, great, I have to deal \\nwith her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don\\'t I just die so as not to\\nhave to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this \\ncondition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn\\'t \\nhave the energy to say, \"How could our people possibly be smart enough to \\nthink of something that yours haven\\'t already done?\" I stayed there. Then they\\nbrought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her \\nown apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next \\nmorning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn\\'t do anything to help us. This\\nwas in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn\\'t do anything \\nmore than examine me, that was it. I didn\\'t want any shots or tranquilizer, \\nnothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn\\'t even want to look at \\nthem.\\n\\nI lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-\\npose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That\\nsame evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face\\nwas disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \"Better to ask \\nyour brother what happened, there\\'s no point in asking me, your brother can \\nbetter explain what happened.\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw \\nthemselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my\\nward.\\n\\nThen people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me \\nclothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, \\nbut the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up \\nabove my knees, and the woman orderly said, \"I can\\'t believe you put on such a\\nshort dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\" I went back to my \\nward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and \\nbrought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I \\ncouldn\\'t take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said\\nthat I couldn\\'t take the apples, and really didn\\'t have any appetite. No one \\nhad to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . \\nThen I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should \\nbe hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an \\nArmenian, maybe they wouldn\\'t figure it out from looking at me. So they must \\nhave been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something \\nelse would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on\\nthe street, I don\\'t know. In any case, I didn\\'t sleep a wink that night.\\n\\nThe next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, \\nand off we went. I didn\\'t even know where they were taking me. They took me to\\nthe club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.\\nI got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many \\ntroops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw \\na few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought \\nthat I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait \\nafter that night. I still didn\\'t know what happened to my parents, they didn\\'t \\ncome to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. \\nI didn\\'t know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm \\nme down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw \\na lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each \\nother and asking, \"What happened, what went on?\" Two days later they came to \\nsee me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed \\ninterest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they \\ncould. Of course I\\'m most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues \\nwho didn\\'t lose his presence of mind and who didn\\'t change his opinions, \\nneither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what \\nhappened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart \\n. . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, \\nnot from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part \\nof, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements\\nwith the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by\\nmyself I couldn\\'t get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my\\nlungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I \\nlay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be \\nfrom all the blows, I don\\'t know. They didn\\'t diagnose anything in particular.\\nWhen I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of \\ninsisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. \\nThere was no way something inside wasn\\'t broken, my ribs . . . Well they took \\nme there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were \\nemergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina\\'s \\nfriends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children\\'s Clinic. \\nThey had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I\\nneeded at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty\\nbreathing, I couldn\\'t seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.\\nThey put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some\\npeople saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all\\nbandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I\\nwasn\\'t cut.\\n\\nThey took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon \\nappeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not \\ntalk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \"We \\ndemand that Seidov come!\" The response was, \"It\\'s Seidov who sent us.\" Seidov \\nis the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, \\n\"We\\'ll only see Seidov\\'s daughter, have her come here, we\\'ll do the same \\nthings to her that they did to our daughters, and then we\\'ll deal with you \\nagitators.\" And so on. More of them said, \"Have Seidov himself come.\" This \\nwent on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us \\nout of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because \\nthey realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The \\nsmell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who \\nhad literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a \\nclub that didn\\'t even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay \\nto eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day \\nsomeone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.\\nEverything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie \\ntheater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn\\'t sit or lie down, it \\nwas impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants \\ntook ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in \\nYerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to \\nmention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting \\nright and left. I just don\\'t know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only \\nthe young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women \\nwere in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come \\nany minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered \\ntogether purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie \\ntheater and there wouldn\\'t be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to \\nthe attic. I didn\\'t see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and \\ncouldn\\'t get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently \\nthey caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the\\ntheater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn\\'t. I was in no condition to open my \\neyes.\\n\\nEveryone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \"Aren\\'t you an \\nAzerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you\\'re an Azerbaijani.\" They\\nled out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their\\npassports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did\\nnot have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in \\nnothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like\\nthey should have, with their IDs.\\n\\nSo on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On\\nMonday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn\\'t \\nspare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,\\nthey burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered \\nthe Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-\\nin-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only \\nthe two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, \\nshe ran away, the neighbors wouldn\\'t take her in, so she ran about the \\nbuilding until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. \\nThis all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were \\nalready in the city.\\n\\nThey murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire \\nfamilies. They say they didn\\'t even know for sure if the people were Armenians\\nor not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I\\'m not sure myself, I didn\\'t \\nsee any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it\\'s very difficult \\nnow to say exactly who died and who didn\\'t. It was very difficult to identify \\nthe corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in\\ngasoline and burned . . . it\\'s all very hard to imagine, of course I heard \\nthat many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, \\nincluding a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in\\nMicrodistrict 3.\\n\\nThey were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who \\nhad been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were \\ngoing home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply \\nsavagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did \\nwhat they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that \\nhoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians\\nout and killed them on the spot. I didn\\'t see it myself, but I heard that they\\nput them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from \\nthe corpses, well you can\\'t call them corpses, you had to figure out from the \\nashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira\\nG., if I\\'m not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and \\nshe still can\\'t figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and \\nbeaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that \\nwhole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and \\ncarried her to the city. I still can\\'t imagine how he managed to do that.\\n\\nI heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of \\npeople went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a \\nsong in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has \\nthat piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, \\nthe one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They \\ncouldn\\'t find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone\\'s apartment and\\ncalled the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,\\nshe couldn\\'t remember anyone\\'s face.\\n\\nI think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had \\ntalked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked\\nout of my head. I can\\'t remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw\\nthe Secretary of the Directorate\\'s Party organization, where Marina works. She\\ngoes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at\\nthe Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I\\'m the \\nSecretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met \\nwith the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint \\nmeetings. I know them all, I\\'ve even talked with them, and he, I know, is from\\nArmenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of \\nthose people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.\\n\\nThey took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the\\nProcuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-\\ntified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They\\nshowed me the people who were in our apartment, they\\'re working on our\\ncase, but I can\\'t even recognize them, although it was proved that they were\\nthe ones, they\\'re processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that\\nsomeone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were \\ndragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch \\nme, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these \\npeople, all of them, as much as I\\'ve heard about them and seen them, they were\\nall from Kafan.\\n\\nThe Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was \\nthere when everything started. It must have been him because I didn\\'t \\nrecognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since\\nI told him, \"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\" He turned away \\nand went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn\\'t see Marina \\nanyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn\\'t make out \\nanyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became \\nmyself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people \\nthere. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his \\nname. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one \\nwe\\'re part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \"If\\nhe\\'s here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his \\nalibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I\\'m crazy, not \\nresponsible for my words.\" He said, \"What did they do to you, how awful, \\nmyself, I hid an Armenian family.\" Then after some time goes by he comes back \\nagain and says something entirely different: \"I wasn\\'t at home, my family and \\nI went to Baku.\" I said, \"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally\\ndifferent before.\" After that I didn\\'t go to see our Procurator, our case is \\nbeing handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me \\nthat Rzayev\\'s case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. \\nWhat are they doing with Rzayev?\\nDid he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the \\nhead I can\\'t say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an \\ninsult if he was in our apartment and doesn\\'t have to pay for it, but at the \\nsame time\\n\\nI\\'m afraid to say I\\'m a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-\\nter who I name, they tell me, no, you\\'re wrong, he didn\\'t do that, that one\\nwasn\\'t there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what\\nexactly I can\\'t say.                                                     \\n\\nWhen they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn\\'t see it, \\nbecause I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got\\nit because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it \\nalways seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my \\nface I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, \\nthey took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he\\nworks at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, \\nis where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ \\ndormitory is over there, that\\'s where he lives. Now he\\'s in custody, they even\\nhave proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the\\nclarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our \\nbuilding was killed, it was that man.\\n\\nA guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that\\nhe was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn\\'t come \\nover, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was \\nall over, people started making announcements in town saying that \\ninvestigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now \\nthey\\'ve caught him, everything\\'s been proved. Now, evidently, they\\'ve been\\nbeating him, I don\\'t know what they\\'re doing with them over there, but he \\nhimself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy \\ncame to the plant and said, \"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the \\nbus station on Saturday at ten.\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,\\nwent. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday\\nnight. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do \\nyou mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, \\nprobably, in their hearts they were thinking, I\\'m going to go. But they didn\\'t\\nsay anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, \\nbecause he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had \\nkilled their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of \\nthat. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that \\nthe Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from\\n\\nI\\'ve participated in the investigation a couple of times. I\\'m satisfied with\\nthem thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word \\nI said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an \\nArmenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don\\'t know. \\nHis last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from \\nMicrodistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. \\nHis mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani \\nKGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many \\nphotographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at \\ncurfew, and I\\'ve got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, \\nthe guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off\\nand burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a \\nhaystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he \\nis so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don\\'t know what he did, \\nI can\\'t remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. \\nAt the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there\\'s no need for this, \\nall this stuff, look me in the eyes, you\\'re like a sister to me. I took a look\\nat him and thought, \"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like \\nyou.\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything \\nwithout great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when \\nshe came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over\\nthe table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the\\nbalcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had \\nall kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. \\nThey stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that \\nmoment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the \\nfaces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the \\napartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I\\'ve got three kids and \\nno place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn\\'t have \\nanywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the \\napartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the \\napartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That\\'s what they said. How did they \\nknow there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that\\nArmenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the \\nbuilding, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis \\nlived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn\\'t set fire to our \\napartment.\\n\\nI don\\'t know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt \\nwhen I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would\\nhave said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but\\nprobably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw\\nthat all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at\\na free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were\\nbeing fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have\\nbeen fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from \\nour building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \"Karina, we \\nsaw all of it, how could it happen?\" They\\'re asking me! Well I just don\\'t know\\nwhat to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to \\nme. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn\\'t have been \\nable to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani \\nwoman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated \\nwoman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two \\nArmenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the\\nbalcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She \\ncame down to the entryway and said, \"You\\'ll come in this entryway over my dead\\nbody.\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some \\nfolks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn\\'t \\neven know what they were doing. I don\\'t think that\\'s true. They knew very well\\nwhat they were doing if they didn\\'t even lift a hand against that woman. They \\ncouldn\\'t have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani \\nstopped them.\\n\\nThey were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place \\nthey were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the \\napartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? \\nMaybe I\\'m losing my mind? But no, they\\'re all chewing something. Maybe it is \\nsome kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed \\nto be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had \\ncome to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They\\ndidn\\'t talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They \\nscreamed and screamed: \"Yeah, killing, killing, we\\'re killing the Armenians!\" \\nOnly they didn\\'t shout \"kill,\" they shouted \"gurun ermianlary.\" Gurun \\nliterally means \"kill,\" or \"destroy.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s how it was! I\\'ll continue. We hid in a captain\\'s apartment, he\\'s an\\nAzerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their \\nkids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part \\nof the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn\\'t find\\nLyuda she took Papa\\'s hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,\\nbut they didn\\'t pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently\\nthey had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the\\ncourage to . . .\\n\\nA boy said to my mother \"Where\\'s the gold?\" Mamma said he must have been 12 \\nto 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the \\nAzerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the \\nfair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where \\nthe gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a \\nlittle black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn\\'t really like to \\nwear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were \\nbought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma\\nthinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and \\nMamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, \\nbound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had \\nshoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and \\ntore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having \\ntrouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and \\nstarted running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted \\nto open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by \\naccident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, \\n\"What\\'s happened?\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \"At least go and \\nfind out what\\'s happening to my daughters, even if they\\'ve burned them or \\nmurdered them, at least bring the corpses.\" He went looking for us. At that \\nmoment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that \\nsomeone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn\\'t get out \\nfrom under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought \\nshe was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to \\nherself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from \\nunder the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost\\nher mind. I\\'ll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that \\nway to me, I\\'ll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled \\ndown, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from\\noutside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don\\'t remember what order it\\nhappened in.\\n\\nAnd Mamma said, \"Listen, they\\'re all running around down there, shouting \\nsomething or other, and running toward the other building.\" It had more or \\nless calmed down where we were. Who\\'s dead, who\\'s alive, we don\\'t know. I \\ntried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \"Listen;\\nlet\\'s go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don\\'t know how \\nlong we\\'ll be here. Maybe they didn\\'t burn everything.\" I don\\'t get it, all\\nwomen have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe \\nnot everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \"Mamma, what do you need any of that \\nfor? To hell with it! We\\'re alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\" She\\nsays, \"No, let\\'s go get at least something. Maybe we\\'ll leave here, spend the \\nnight at someone else\\'s.\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son\\nAlik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were \\ncoming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He \\nshouts, \"Come back, they\\'re coming!\" They didn\\'t have enough time to get a \\nlot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my \\nknitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,\\nout of the hall . . . Someone took Father\\'s old coveralls. The neighbor, his \\nwife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to \\nleave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and\\njust then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, \\nthey\\'re dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, \\nmaybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over\\nthere, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished \\nbuilding, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more \\nor less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.\\n\\nLater there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom\\napartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,\\nAsya Dallakian. She\\'s an old woman, retired. She wasn\\'t at home, at that\\ntime she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and\\nher grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her\\nretirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started\\npounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, \\nsomething like that, she\\'s a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even \\nlive there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and \\nmattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. \\nThey started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \"My \\nGod, what is going on around here? When will this end?\" We turned off the \\nlights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren\\'t afraid, the ones who \\nknew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn\\'t know, but \\nthey didn\\'t come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that \\nhe was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his \\napartment. His last name was Kasumov. He\\'s an exserviceman, retired, works up \\nat the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.\\nThey tell him, \"Comrade Captain, don\\'t worry, we won\\'t harm you, you\\'re one of\\nus.\" He went upstairs, and they say, \"Aren\\'t you taking anything from this \\napartment?\" He says, \"I don\\'t need anything.\" And the women who were standing \\nin the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were \\nstanding in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the \\nfirst floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time \\nto into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty \\npillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really \\nmad, and he says, \"Where\\'s the rug? I just put it right here!\" They tell him, \\n\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\" He ran off in that\\ndirection.\\n\\nOh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, \\nthere were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They \\njust didn\\'t tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, \\nshe didn\\'t want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told \\nme, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, \\nthe ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \"Where\\'s the girl who was here?\"\\nAnd he became furious. The woman tells him, \"She came to . . . \" She didn\\'t\\nknow what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would\\ncomb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \"She\\ncame to and went to the basement.\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the \\nwhole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took \\nflashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been \\nstanding there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there \\nto get me. Then one of them said, \"There\\'s so much water down there, she \\nprobably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in \\nthe basement. That\\'s it, we can leave, no problem!\" I didn\\'t know that, and \\nwhen I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn\\'t \\njust want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .\\n\\nAfter that we of course didn\\'t want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really \\ndidn\\'t want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and \\nstarted to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. \\nAlthough the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people \\nwho sat in their apartments and didn\\'t help us at a time like that. I think \\nthat they could have helped! I don\\'t think that they were obligated to, but \\nthey could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole \\nbrutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been\\nenough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you\\'re doing?\" That\\'s \\nall! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not \\none person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were \\nstanding on their balconies I didn\\'t hear anyone\\'s voice, no one said what are\\nyou doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women \\nthat if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a\\nbomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for \\none of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, \\nan old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: \\nif a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed \\nto stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they\\nstomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \"If\\nyou want to go on living, you\\'ll disappear into your apartment.\" So she left.\\nThat trick didn\\'t work on them.\\n\\nEven the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget \\nthat it happened. I said I\\'d only forget it if I told them right then that it\\nhad happened to their daughter--and if that didn\\'t have any effect on them, \\nthen I would forget everything, too.

Patients are generally kept on steroids for\\nmonths before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are \\nevery other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start.\\nAnother option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start\\nazathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug\\nin addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics\\nabout options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of \\ndisease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it\\nis worth.  \\n\\nI treat patients with UC and Crohn's.

Of course it didn\\'t have the initial power\\nburst to just twist it into the air - I had to pop the clutch. I also\\nhad to replace front fork seals a few times as well. The fairing is a \\nbit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the\\ntime. But let me give you fair warning: I trashed the ring/pinion gear\\nin the final drive of my K75 (I assume) doing wheelies. And this was \\nNO cheap fix either!! There is some kind of \"slip\" device in the shaft\\nto prevent IT from breaking. Unfortunately, it didn\\'t save the gears!\\n\\n  On the topic of wheelies, the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricane\\ndo a \"stoppy\"(?), or rear wheelie. Man, he had the rear end on this bike \\nup about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light. I don\\'t recommend these\\nactivities anymore (now that I\\'m an \"old guy\" with kids of my own) but\\nit looked damn impressive!!\\n\\n  If you can\\'t keep both tires on the ground, at least have \\'em pointed\\nin that direction! :-)\\n\\nCheers, \\nB**2\\n',\n",

I won the battle but \\nlost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was \\ndefective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below \\nmarket value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average \\nretail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but \\nthe decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the \\nCouncil of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the \\nfact that if you have an automobile that does not \\ndepreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive \\nto deal with you.  There is no way that the \\nmanufacturer can loose because they can turn around and \\nsell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded \\na repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet\\'s \\nrepresentative at the hearing tends to support this \\npoint of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not \\nseem to take the proceeding very seriously.\\n\\nI decided to take the repurchase, even though I am \\ngetting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have \\nto deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon \\nmyself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on \\nthe Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to \\nmy elected representatives telling them how utterly \\nridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for \\na \"use deduction\" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.  \\nAs if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying \\nfor my insurance.\\n\\nSummary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton\\nHD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992 \\nthis vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems \\nthat required attention included the transmission, \\nheater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.

If anything, one could claim that,\\nin a sense, Daniel is a descendant of Zoroaster; as Daniel, though being\\nHebrew, has assimilated into Zoroastrianism and has successfully\\nintroduced the religion into the Tanakh of Judaism. [However, the majority \\nof the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic (not Babylonian Aramaic) and only has\\nKethuvim or Writing status.]\\n\\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade:\\n\\nDANIEL, or, in Hebrew, Daniyye\\'l; hero of the biblical book that bears his name.\\nDaniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in\\nthe royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his\\nsalvation from death in a lion\\'s pit. He also appears in the last chapters of\\nthe book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel\\'s\\nrestoration to national-religious autonomy. As a practitioner of oneiromancy in\\nthe court, described in Daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), Daniel per-\\nforms his interpretations alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in Daniel\\n7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him\\ndecode his visions and mysteries of the future. It is likely that the name\\nDaniel is pseudonymous, a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known\\nfrom Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (Ez. 14:4,28:3).\\n  The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative\\nvoices and content but by its language: Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in\\nHebrew, whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic. The language division parallels\\nthe subject division (Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations;\\n7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). The\\noverall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (Daniel 2-7\\nis chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. After the\\nprefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some\\nyouths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: a\\nsequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported (Dn. 7-12). Much of\\nthis royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example,\\nDaniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar\\'s transformation into a beast, a story that\\nis reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus; Belshazzar is portrayed as the\\nlast king of Babylon, although he was never king; and Darius is called a Mede\\nwho conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia, although no such\\nDarius is known (the Medes followed the Persians, and Darius is the name of\\nseveral Persian kings). Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6, depicting a\\nseries of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports of\\nmiraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period (late fourth to\\nmid-second century BCE) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine\\nprovidence and encourage steadfast faith.\\n  The visions of Daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to\\nthat of Cyrus II (but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in\\nPalestine), were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior\\nto the Maccabean Revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 BCE) that the Jews\\nwere put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral\\ntraditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a\\nmartyr\\'s death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. All of the visions\\nof Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images of\\nthe enthronement of a God of judgment, with a \"son of man\" invested with rule\\n(this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians\\nas Christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre\\nmanifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient\\nprophecies, especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in Daniel 9-12.\\n  The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four\\nmetals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth\\nmonarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur-\\nvived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes\\nto the end of the Middle Ages. The role and power of this imagery in the\\nfifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel, the\\nscientist Isaac Newton, and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth\\nMonarchy Men of seventeenth century England, for example, is abiding testimony\\nto the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of\\ndiverse thinkers and groups. The schema is still used to this day by various\\ngroups predicting the apocalyptic advent.\\n  The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and\\npropagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah\\n52:13-53:12, regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as\\nthe select faithful. Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor\\nthe final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they rather\\nadvocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation.\\nVictory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael, and the\\nmartyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. Persumably the\\ncircles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may\\nreflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists. The themes of\\nresistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheistic\\nintegrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement of\\nthe God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of\\ntrust for the faithful in their darkest hour.\\n\\nZARATHUSHTRA, founder of the religion know as Zoroastrianism or Mazdaism (from\\nMazda or Ahura Mazda, the name of the god prophesied by Zarathushtra.) The\\netymology and history of Zarathushtra, the Avestan and oldest form of the name,\\nas uncertain, both in various Iranian languages and in related forms else-\\nwhere. There may have been an Old Persian form, Zara-ushtra, from which the\\nGreek form, Zoroastres, may be derived, and there may have existed an Old\\nIranian form, Zarat-ushtra, to which may be linked the Middle Iranian Zrdrwsht,\\nseveral Middle Persian forms (such as Zrtwsht), and the New Persian Zardusht.\\nWe can state with certainty only that the second half of the name, ushtra,\\nmeans \"camel.\" The form Zoroaster, derived from the Greek Zoroastres, was used\\ntraditionally in European culture until the eighteenth century, when\\nZarathustra, closer to the original (and as found in Nietzsche), came into\\ncommon use after the rediscovery of the Avesta, the collection of sacred books\\nof Zoroastrianism, and the resulting studies in Iranian philology. [See Avesta.]\\n  Notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of Zarathushtra, even in\\nWestern culture, the sources available to us are few, extremely fragmented,\\nand heterogeneous. Our principle sources are the five Gathas (\"songs\"),\\nattributed to Zarathushtra himself and included in the Yasna section of the\\nAvesta: Gatha Ahunavaiti (Yasna 28-34), Gatha Ushtavaiti (Yasna 43-46), Gatha\\nSpentamainyu (Yasna 47-50), Gatha Vokukhshathra (Yasna 51), and Gatha\\nVashishtoishti (Yasna 53), the last of which was probably written after the\\nprophet\\'s death.\\n  Other sources of considerable, albeit varying, importance are the Younger\\nAvesta and the remaining Zoroastrian religious literature, in particular the\\nPahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures CE. Although the Achaemenid\\ninscriptions (sixth to fourth centures BCE) never mention Zarathushtra, he is\\nmentioned by some Greek sources of the time (not, however, by Herodotus, who\\nseems unaware of him).\\n  The Avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true\\nchronological history of Zarathushtra. But the text is useful in an indirect\\nway, as it clearly implies that the environment in which Zoroastrianism arose\\nwas not that of Iran under the Medes or the Persians. The Greek sources, on the\\nother hand, do provide some information concerning the time of Zarathushtra,\\nalthough from a historical point of view they are unreliable. Some place him\\nsix thousand years before the Trojan War (Xanthus of Lydia, Eudoxus of Cnidus,\\nHermippus, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and Pliny). The\\naccount by Xanthus of Lydia, however, has also been interpreted by some to mean\\nsix hundred, rather than six thousand, years before the expedition of Xerxes\\nagainst Greece. This interpretation is favored by Diogenes Laertius, who makes\\nreference to Xanthus, but although a few scholars (A. S. Shabazi, Helmut\\nHumbach) have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts, it\\nis generally rejected.\\n  Although the historical value of the Greek sources is negligible, they are\\nnonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history\\nof the cosmos had already been developed in Iran by the Achaemenid period, as\\nthe above account would seem to demonstrate. They also show that by this time\\nZarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure, one from an\\nextremely distant past. All of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet\\ncould not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with, or even close\\nto, that of the Achaemenids.\\n  Later Zoroastrian sources, the Pahlavi texts, do provide an absolute chrono-\\nlogy for Zarathushtra, one that was also accepted by some Arab authors. Accord-\\ning to these sources, Zarathushtra lived 300 or 258 years before Alexander.\\nAgain, scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology; some view it as\\nhistorically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical\\njustification. The most convincing arguments, however, seem to support the\\nlatter position. The figure of 258 years is accurate only on the surface\\nbecause it represents, in fact, the more general one of 300, which was employed\\nby Sasanid propagandists to locate Zarathushtra\\'s lifetime roughly around the\\nbeginning of Iranian domination. For a number of reasons connected with complex\\nproblems inherent in the Iranian chronology, there was also a desire on the\\npart of the Sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat. In this\\ncontext, Zarathushtra, whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after\\nthe beginning of the cosmos, converted Vishtaspa at the age of forty-two, and\\nVishtaspa\\'s conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium\\n(thus explaining the double date of 300 and 258 years before Alexander).\\n  Given the unreliability of the few available sources, we are forced to\\nreconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements, principally\\non the contention that Zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before Cyrus\\nthe Great, Cambyses, and Darius, as there is no mention in the Avesta of the\\ngreat political achievements that took place in western Iran in the middle of\\nthe first millennium BCE. Nor is there any mention of the history of that\\nperiod, which was to lead Iran to a position of such predominance. At the same\\ntime, for a number of reasons, going back much further in history would not be\\njustified. Consequently, the traditionally accepted theory of placing Zara-\\nthushtra around the beginning of the first millennium BCE appears to be the\\nmost legitimate.\\n  As to Zarathushtra\\'s land of origin, many scholars agree, on the basis of\\nvalid arguments, that he must have come from eastern Iran. Some have held that\\nhe was a Mede, largely because of a late Iranian tradition linking Zarathushtra\\nwith Azerbaijan, but also because of linguistic reasons, based on the language\\nof the Avesta. This hypothesis, however, should be discarded, as we can suppose,\\nboth on historical and linguistic grounds, that Zarathushtra came from the east,\\neven though we do not know precisely from which region. There is a considerable\\nvariety of opinion on this particular matter, including the improbable view\\nthat he came from Chorasmia, or present-day Khorezm, or from a wider Chorasmian\\nregion, reaching as far as the oases of Merv and Herat. Most likely, however,\\nZarathushtra\\'s land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the\\nHindu Kush mountain range to the more southern regions of Bactria and Arachosia\\n(modern Qandahar), as well as Drangiana (the area of lake Helmand). It would\\nthus be located in what is now Afghanistan or in the border regions of Iran.\\n  Zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste (Yasna\\n33.6). He was a zaotar (cf. Sanskrit hotr), that is, a priest belonging to a\\nspecific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned\\nreligious poetry. Even in the so-called Younger Avesta he is described as an\\nathravan (Yashts 13.94), a more general term encompassing the entire priestly\\ncaste. To enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training, which he used\\nto lend dignity (as in the Gathas) to the contents of his new message, the\\nproduct of a great and original ethical mind.\\n  Zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition, linking India\\nto Iran in another way, by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan,\\nor \"possessor of asha,\" that is, the one who, as in the Vedic rtavan, seeks\\ntruth and masters it, thus becoming ashavan in this life - almost an initiate -\\nand blessed after death. Any good follower of such teachings seeks the \"vision\\nof asha,\" just as those chosing the right path in Vedic India aspired to the\\n\"vision of the Sun,\" a manifestation of rta. Behind these concepts and this\\nlanguage lies the great tradition of \"Aryan mysticism,\" that is, of Indo-Iranian\\nmysticism.\\n  Zarathushtra\\'s greatness, however, does not lie in his having belonged to a\\nparticular religious tradition. Rather, it lies in the innovation and strength\\nof his message, which was in itself a break in the tradition, one that force-\\nfully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas: dualistic\\nmonotheism (the Wise Lord who fathers two twin spirits, the beneficent and the\\nevil); and the expectation of a transfiguration (Av., Frashokereti; Pahl.,\\nFrashgird) of life and existence. [See Frashokereti] \\n  Both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological\\ndoctrine deeply separate Zarathushtra\\'s teachings from the Indo-Iranian tradi-\\ntions of his upbringing. They exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic\\nand ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem\\nof evil. Because of his basic tenets, Zarathushtra, who advocated an inward\\nreligiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi-\\ntion, can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures.\\n  Another original facet of Zarathushtra\\'s message, one that is not easy to\\nunderstand but which, however, holds the key to a deeper understanding of the\\ncomplex intellectual and poetic structure of the Gathas, is the doctrine of the\\nAmesha Spentas, the \"beneficent immortals.\" These are spiritualizations of the\\nabstract notions of good thought, best truth, desirable power, bounteous\\ndevotion, wholeness, and immortality, all of which operate according to a\\nsystem of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the\\nmanifestations of a divinity and of human virtue. [See Amesha Spentas.]\\n  Other than the names of his father, Pourushaspa (\"possessing gray horses\"),\\nand of his mother, Dughdova (\"one who has milked\"), we know almost nothing of\\nZarathushtra\\'s life. A late Pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers.\\nAccording to tradition, Zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty, and at\\nthirty he was subject to a revelation, both through an intense and powerful\\ninspiration and through a vision. Only after ten years had passed, however, did\\nhe succeed in converting a cousin of his, Maidhyoimah, to his beliefs. He was\\nstrongly opposed in his native land by kavis, karapans, and usijs, priestly\\ngroups associated with traditional teachings and practices. This hostility\\ncaused him to leave his region (Yasna 46:1) and to seek refuge at the court of\\nKavi Vishtaspa, a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with\\nhis wife, Hutaosa, when the prophet, according to tradition, was forty-two\\nyears old. We also know the name of a son, Isat Vastra (\"desiring pastures\"),\\nand of three daughters born of his first wife, as well as the names of two more\\nsons, Urvatatnara (\"commanding men\") and Hvarecithra (\"sun-faced\"), born of\\nhis second wife, Hvovi, a member of the influential Hvogva (\"possessing good\\ncattle\") family. Two other figures belonging to the Hvogva family are mentioned:\\nFrashaoshtra and Jamaspa, the former as Hvovi\\'s father, and the latter as the\\nhusband of the third daughter of the prophet, Pouruchista (\"very thoughtful\"),\\nwhose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the Gathas (Yasna 53). Again,\\naccording to tradition, Zarathushtra died at the age of seventy-seven. He was\\nassassinated by a karapan, a priest of the old religion, who belonged to the\\nTuirya tribe and was called Tur i Bradres (his name is known only in the Pahlavi\\nform).\\n  The paucity of information on the prophet\\'s life is compensated by a tradi-\\ntion, rich in legendary detail, that arose through the centuries in Zoroastrian\\ncommunities. The main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of\\nthe Denkard, a Pahlavi work dating from the ninth century CE, as well as\\npassages from other Pahlavi texts and a New Persian work from the thirteenth\\ncentury, the Zarathusht-nama (Book of Zarathushtra), written by Zaratusht-i\\nBahram-i Pazhdu. Mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about\\nZarathushtra, which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the\\nperfect man.\\n  Zarathushtra\\'s great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the\\nRenaissance until the Enlightenment. During the Classical and Hellenistic\\nperiods he was viewed as a wise man, a typical representative of an \"alien\\nwisdom,\" a master of the secrets of heaven and earth, a seer, astrologer,\\npsychologist, and wonder worker. Pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the\\ninfluence of Zarathushtra on Pythagoras himself, and the Academicians always\\nopenly admired the Persian thinker who founded the school of the Magi and\\nadvocated a doctrine of dualism. Earliest Christianity viewed Zarathushtra as\\na precursor of the Christian faith, one who not only prophesied, as had the\\nbiblical prophets, the advent of the Messiah but also predicted the supernatural\\nsign of his coming, the star that was to appear in the East and guide the three\\nMagi to the manger in Bethlehem. [See Magi.] This Christian interpretation is\\nderived from the Zoroastrian doctrine of the Saoshyant, the Savior of the\\nFuture. [See Saoshyant.] Later, however, religious struggles arose during the\\nSasanid empire in Persia (third to seventh centuries CE), which linked the\\nspread of Christianity with the Roman empire. Zarathushtra\\'s popularity in the\\nChristian world began to decline. The Iranian prophet, who had been praised\\noften by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by Mani as one of the three\\ngreat messengers from the past, was now seen, instead, as a leader of imposture\\nand heresy, a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery. But during the Renaiss-\\nance and the Enlightenment, European cultures reverted to the image of Zara-\\nthushtra that had come down through Classical and Hellenistic antiquity. He was\\nviewed, once again, as a great and wise man, as the author of the _Chaldean\\nOracles_ and probably inventor of Qabbalah, as a teacher of astrology, as a\\npossible bridge between Christianity and Platonism, and, at times (as in\\nVoltaire), as a symbol of non-Christian wisdom.\\n  After Western philology rediscovered Zarathushtra during the eighteenth and\\nnineteenth centuries, Friedrich Nietzsche, in an intentional paradox, gave\\nthe name Zarathustra to the hero of his work _Also sprach Zarathustra_ (1883-\\n1892). Nietzsche saw the Iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the\\ntrue motive force underlying all things, that is, the eternal struggle between\\ngood and evil.

The SAE numbers are based on a `typical\\'\\ncurve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a\\nroom-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature \\n5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.\\n\\nOils that are designed for operation in `normal\\' temperatures just have\\na weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly\\ncold temperatures have a `W\\' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold\\nplace, you\\'d stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,\\nto approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.\\n\\nModern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.\\nAs a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis\\nspecification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal\\' operating\\ntemperature and a `cold\\' one (though I can\\'t remember the numbers...).\\n\\nIn any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember\\nthat your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and\\nradiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or\\nsomething.\\n\\nAny weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized\\noil.  Thin oil won\\'t (in general) lubricate as well at temperature,\\nthicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, \\nbut not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.  \\n\\nIf you\\'re planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine\\n(esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.

Where Luke (1:17) reports\\nthe angel Gabriel prophesying that John will go before Christ \"in the \\npower and spirit of Elias\", In Matthew 11: 14, Jesus himself says of John,\\n   \\n   \"And if you care to accept it, he himself is Elijah, who\\n    was to come\".\\n\\nIt is interesting that Jesus prepended the words, \"If you care to accept\\nit\", as if to say that the implications of this truth, namely of rein-\\ncarnation, I will not force on you, but for those who can accept it, here it\\nis.  A Jewish poster to other newsgroups on Jewish esotericism and other\\ntopics has outlined the esoteric, cabbalistic Jewish teaching of of\\nreincarnation and Karma, a teaching that is little known among Jews\\ntoday, but which is apparently widespread enough in Israel that Hannah\\nHurnard (\"Hinds Feet on High Places\") was told about it by a Rabbi\\nshe was trying to convert back in the 1940s as a missionary in Palestine.\\nThus there may well have been a small number of Jews who knew about this,\\nwhereas the large number of people did not.  The statement of Jesus about \\nJohn, the greatest human personality in the New Testament, is guarded\\nbut nevertheless quite direct.  Again, the subject of reincarnation, one\\nway or another, is not a subject of the New Testament, nor is the fate in general\\nof the human being between death and the last judgement.  But there are \\noccasional indications that point to it.\\n\\nAs for the \"popular belief\" that Elijah would come again, it was more than \\na popular belief, as Jesus confirms it in more than one place, and he never \\ncorrected those who were expecting Elijah --  for example, those who thought \\nthat Jesus himself be he.\\n\\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\\n',\n",

Who is he? \\n>Please do not answer with \"A well known evolutionist\" or some other such\\n>informationless phrase.\\n\\n   Francis Hitching is the author of, among other books,\\n_The Neck of the Giraffe_.\" He believes evolution is\\ndirected by some sort of cosmic force, but does not like\\nDarwinism.  He wrote in this book [ _The Neck of the\\nGiraffe_, Ticknor & Fields, New Haven, Connecticut, 1982,\\np. 12 (p. 4, paperback)] that:\\n\\n   For all its acceptance in the scientific world as the\\n   great unifying principle of biology, Darwinism, after\\n   a century and a quarter, is in a surprising amount of\\n   trouble.  Evolution and Darwinism are often taken to\\n   mean the same thing.  But they don\\'t.  Evolution of\\n   life over a very long period of time is a fact, if we\\n   are to believe evidence gathered during the last two\\n   centuries from geology, paleontology, molecular biol-\\n   ogy and many other scientific disciplines.  Despite\\n   the many believers in Divine creation who dispute this\\n   ..., the probability that evolution has occurred\\n   approaches certainty in scientific terms....  On the\\n   other hand Darwinism (or neo-Darwinism, its modern\\n   version) is a theory that seeks to explain evolution.\\n   It has not, contrary to general belief, and despite\\n   very great efforts, been proved.\\n\\n   Research on Hitching turned up the following: Hitching is\\nbasically a sensational TV script writer and has no scien-\\ntific credentials.  In _The Neck of the Giraffe_ he claimed\\nto be a member of the Royal Archaeological Institute, but an\\ninquiry to that institute said he was not.  He implied in\\nthe \"Acknowledgements\" of _The Neck of the Giraffe_ that\\npaleontologist Stephen Jay Gould had helped in the writing\\nof the book, but upon inquiry Gould said he did not know him\\nand had no information about him.  Hitching also implied\\nthat his book had been endorsed by Richard Dawkins, but upon\\ninquiry Dawkins stated: \"I know nothing at all about Francis\\nHitching.  If you are uncovering the fact that he is a char-\\nlatan, good for you.  His book, _The Neck of the Giraffe,_\\nis one of the silliest and most ignorant I have read for\\nyears.\"\\n\\n   Hitching believes in the paranormal and has written on\\nMayan pyramid energy and for some \"In Search Of...\" episodes\\non BBC television.  The reference work _Contemporary\\nAuthors,_ Vol. 103, page 208, lists him as a member of the\\nSociety for Psychical Research, the British Society of\\nDowsers and of the American Society of Dowsers.  His writ-\\nings include: _Earth Magic,_ _Dowsing: The Psi Connection,_\\n_Mysterious World: An Atlas of the Unexplained,_ _Fraud,\\nMischief, and the Supernatural_ and _Instead of Darwin_.\\n\\n   Hitching\\'s book spends much of its time attacking Dar-\\nwinian evolution, borrowing heavily and uncritically from\\nyoung-earth creationist arguments.  Many of Hitching\\'s \"ref-\\nerences\" are lifted from young-earth creationist literature\\nrather than being quoted directly from their original\\nsources.  One magazine had this to say [_Creation/Evolution\\nNewsletter_, 7, No. 5, pp. 15-16, September/October 1987]:\\n\\n   Speaking of the Biblical Creation Society, there was\\n   an interesting letter in the January 1983 issue of\\n   their journal Biblical Creation (p. 74) concerning a\\n   review of Francis Hitching\\'s 1982 book _The Neck of\\n   the Giraffe_.  Hitching\\'s book is strongly anti-\\n   Darwinist, and is enthusiastically hailed by most cre-\\n   ationists (though he also pokes fun at fundamentalist\\n   creationists).  The letter, by creationist Malcolm\\n   Bowden (author of _The Rise of the Evolution Fraud_),\\n   points out that Hitching simply \"culled his informa-\\n   tion from the creationist literature.\"  This is indeed\\n   the case:  many creationist works are cited favorably\\n   (Anderson, Coffin, Clark, Daly, Davidheiser, Dewar,\\n   Gish, Morris, Segraves, Whitcomb, and Wysong, plus\\n   various anti-Darwinists).  Hitching does cite Bowden\\'s\\n   earlier book _Ape-Men -- Fact or Fallacy?_, but Bowden\\n   accuses Hitching of \"lifting\" several passages and\\n   illustrations from his book without acknowledgment:\\n   in other words, plagiarism.  \"Hitchin\\'s [sic] book is\\n   largely an exposition of the creationists [sic] view-\\n   point from the beginning to almost the end,\" Bowden\\n   points out....  Hitching is also a paranormalist, an\\n   advocate of psychic evolution.... [Hitching\\'s book]\\n   _Earth Magic_ is a wild, extremely entertaining and\\n   thoroughly psychic interpretation of megalithic struc-\\n   tures....  Hitching also includes in his scheme cosmic\\n   cataclysms, Atlantis, pyramidology, dowsing, ESP,\\n   miraculous healing, and astrology.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAlan Feuerbacher\\nalanf@atlas.pen.tek.com\\n\\n',\n",

In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay\\n>>people to be aware of the Lord\\'s presence.\\n\\nAs a former Catholic and now as a very active Lutheran - it is some of the\\n\"innovations\" of the Mass which made me leave the Catholic Church and return\\nto the more traditional Catholic Chuch - the Lutherans.\\n\\nI spent many years as a Lector reading the Passion parts as appropriate in\\nthe Catholic Church and I found it very meaningful.  Our Lutheran parish just\\ninstituted the \"Tenebrae\" service for Good Friday and I was the lector for \\na paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned things\\nthat I have previously overlooked in the Gospels - yet those \"facts\" were\\nalways there.  As a matter of interest, the pastor and I were talking about\\nthe differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week over\\nbreakfast Easter Sunday.\\n>\\n>   As a member of a liturgy committee, I can tell you that the problem\\n>is certain people dominating, who want to try out all kinds of\\n>innovations.  The priests don\\'t seem even to _want_ to make any\\n>decisions of their own in many cases.  I guess it\\'s easier to \"try\\n>something new\" than it is to refuse to allow it.\\n\\nMy wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family (called music\\nand worship at our church).  Our pastor does have control of this committee\\nbut listens very carefully to the committee\\'s suggestions.  It needs a strong\\nhand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strong\\nas it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additional\\nreason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritual\\nguidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA \"wishy-washy\".\\n \\nAs you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir-\\nregardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotes\\nthe true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in a\\ntraditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacrament\\nof PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth.\\nThe reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings\\nare not shared by everyone.\\n\\nI want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don\\'t want \\nthem attending a show.  It\\'s not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful\\nservice during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of\\nWorship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such\\nas the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it\\nis Not there.\\n\\nQuite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and \"fit in\".\\nMy dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigils\\nwould intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics who\\nhave beared with me this far understand what I mean.\\n\\nPlease keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  Not\\nto worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is something\\nwrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest or\\npastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldn\\'t listen.  They are there to \\nprovide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.  My differences with\\nthe Catholic Church are much more fundamental - but my decision to change\\nfaiths was done with prayer, intervention, and sessions with priests and\\nministers.\\n\\nIn Christ,\\nKershner\\n-- \\nKershner Wyatt\\nkwyatt@ccscola.ColumbiaSC.ncr.com\\n\\nMy opinions are my own and aren\\'t necessarily my employer\\'s.\\n',\n",

Ancient astronomers observed points of\\nlight that appeared to move among the stars. They called these\\nobjects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman\\ndeities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;\\nMercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and\\nbeauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The\\nstargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors\\nor shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.\\n\\n     Science flourished during the European Renaissance.\\nFundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were\\ndiscovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were\\ncalculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device\\ncalled the telescope at the heavens and made startling\\ndiscoveries.\\n\\n     But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of\\nsolar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World\\nWar II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth\\'s gravity\\nand travel to the Moon and to other planets.\\n\\n     The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then\\nhuman-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated\\nmachines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the\\nSun\\'s environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys\\nwhile flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\\n\\n     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and\\nunderstanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight\\nand other \"senses\" of our automated spacecraft, color and\\ncomplexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared\\nto Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.\\nAnd dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.\\n\\n     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights\\nthrough the solar system as some of the most remarkable\\nachievements of the 20th century.\\n     \\n\\nAUTOMATED SPACECRAFT\\n\\n     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\\'s (NASA\\'s)\\nautomated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many\\nshapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and\\nspecific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.\\n\\n     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments\\nselected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems\\nfor electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well\\nas for processing data and communicating with Earth.\\n\\n     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft\\ninstruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays\\nof photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its\\nsolar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for\\nbackup and supplemental power.\\n\\n     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed\\nmillions of miles through space to fly but one time near a\\nplanet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments\\npointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help\\nprevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to\\ncontrol spacecraft.\\n\\n     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a\\nconstant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth\\'s early seafarers\\nused the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to\\nmaintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto\\nfixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a\\nspacecraft\\'s scientific instruments pointed at the target body\\nand the craft\\'s communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The\\nthrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed\\nof the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at\\nthe planned distance and on the proper trajectory.\\n\\n     Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to\\nstudy the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the\\ninner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These\\nthree worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets\\nbecause they share a solid-rock composition.\\n\\n     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA\\nemployed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the\\nMariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later\\nmissions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted\\nthe first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.\\n\\n     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power\\nsource. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had\\ntwo wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were\\nequipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal\\nbodies.\\n\\n     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus\\nspacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the\\nMariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147\\npounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the\\nprogram. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had\\noriginally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The\\nMariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components\\nleft over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.\\n\\n     In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.\\nInterest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,\\nSaturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite\\ndifferent from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.\\n\\n     Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers\\n-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar\\nsystem. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took\\nanywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.\\nBarring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first\\nhuman artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun\\'s\\nlight becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers\\ndo not use solar power but instead operate on electricity\\ngenerated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.\\n\\n     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit\\nour neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin\\nViking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather\\nstations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --\\ndescendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers\\nfrom Earth and then studied martian features from above.\\n\\n     Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.\\nThe Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument\\nthat allowed it to \"see\" through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover\\nto study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried\\nfour probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and\\nthe main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --\\nradioed information about the planet\\'s atmosphere during their\\ndescent toward the surface.\\n\\n     A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including\\nMagellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet\\nRendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being\\ndeveloped and sent out into the solar system to make detailed\\nexaminations that will increase our understanding of our\\nneighborhood and our own planet.\\n     \\n\\nThe Sun\\n\\n     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start\\nwith the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing\\napproximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;\\nall of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up\\nto only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the\\nmaterial left over from the Sun\\'s formation. One hundred and nine\\nEarths would be required to fit across the Sun\\'s disk, and its\\ninterior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.\\n\\n     As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of\\nfusion. The temperature at the Sun\\'s core is 15 million degrees\\nCelsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there\\nis 340 billion times Earth\\'s air pressure at sea level. The Sun\\'s\\nsurface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees\\nFahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.\\nAt the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing\\nenergy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams\\nof charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.\\n\\n     The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years\\nand has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or\\nso. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium\\ninto heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing\\nso large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a\\n\"red giant,\" it will suddenly collapse into a \"white dwarf\" --\\nthe final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion\\nyears to cool off completely.\\n\\n     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun\\'s environment, but\\nnone have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately\\ntwo-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,\\nthe Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft\\nhave all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,\\nlaunched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and\\nthe European Space Agency. After using Jupiter\\'s gravity to\\nchange its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun\\'s polar\\nregions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of\\nstudies using nine onboard scientific instruments.\\n\\n     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If\\nit were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly\\nnever have developed on Earth.\\n     \\n\\nMercury\\n\\n     Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the\\nprimary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on\\nNovember 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a\\njourney of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,\\nthe spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the\\nsolar system\\'s innermost planet on March 29, 1974.\\n\\n     Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the\\nbest telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct\\nobject lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the\\nSun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is\\nvisible on Earth\\'s horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it\\nis obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar\\ntelescopes gave any hint of Mercury\\'s surface conditions prior to\\nthe voyage of Mariner 10.\\n\\n     The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an\\nancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own\\nMoon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the\\nplanet. These apparently were created when Mercury\\'s interior\\ncooled and shrank, buckling the planet\\'s crust. The cliffs are as\\nhigh as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310\\nmiles).\\n\\n     Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak\\nmagnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the\\ndensity of Earth\\'s atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon\\nand helium. When the planet\\'s orbit takes it closest to the Sun,\\nsurface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees\\nFahrenheit) on Mercury\\'s sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius\\n(-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface\\ntemperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --\\nis the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury\\nliterally bakes and freezes at the same time.\\n\\n     Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a\\nslow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid\\nrevolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury\\nsolar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time\\nit takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the\\nSun! \\n\\n     Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like\\nthat of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich\\ncore making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would\\nmake Mercury\\'s core larger, proportionally, than the Moon\\'s core\\nor those of any of the planets.\\n\\n     After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two\\nadditional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --\\nbefore control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted\\nand the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same\\nlocal Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was\\nilluminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the\\nplanet\\'s surface.\\n     \\n\\nVenus\\n\\n     Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary\\nneighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2\\nspacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more\\nthan a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the\\nmysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,\\nplunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus\\' surface,\\nromantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to\\nrest.\\n\\n     On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839\\nkilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first\\nspacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured\\nVenus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much\\ncloser to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544\\nmiles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5\\'s\\ninstruments measured the planet\\'s magnetic field, ionosphere,\\nradiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner\\n10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth\\nshowing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.\\n\\n     In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were\\nlaunched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4\\nof the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first\\nspacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.\\n\\n     Five days later, the five separate components making up the\\nsecond spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the\\nVenusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The\\nfour small, independent probes and the main body radioed\\natmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the\\nsurface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the\\nprobes survived its impact with the surface and continued to\\ntransmit data for another hour.\\n\\n     Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and\\ndensity more closely than any other known planet. However,\\nspacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For\\nexample, Venus\\' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)\\ncompared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other\\nplanets.\\n\\n     Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus\\' atmosphere (95 times as\\ndense as Earth\\'s) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of\\nEarth\\'s atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus\\' atmosphere acts like a\\ngreenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but\\ntrapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into\\nspace. As a result, the planet\\'s average surface temperature is\\n482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt\\nlead.\\n\\n     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the\\nfirst means of seeing through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover and\\ndetermining surface features over almost the entire planet.\\nNASA\\'s Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in\\norbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses\\nradar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images\\nof the surface.\\n\\n     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic\\nfeatures, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface\\nshow evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows\\nlying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar\\nTerra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At\\none end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size\\nof Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain\\'s flank is a\\n100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep\\nimpact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are\\nnamed for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are\\nthe exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million\\nyears because there is no water and very little wind erosion.\\n\\n     Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the\\nresult of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics\\non Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to\\nweaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing\\nthe formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like\\nthe San Andreas Fault in California.\\n\\n     Venus\\' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,\\nhigh-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At\\nspeeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,\\nthe clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The\\ncirculation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus\\'\\nslow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth\\'s winds blow in\\nboth directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six\\nalternating bands. Venus\\' atmosphere serves as a simplified\\nlaboratory for the study of our weather.\\n     \\n\\nEarth\\n\\n     As viewed from space, our world\\'s distinguishing\\ncharacteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses\\nand white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting\\nof 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other\\nconstituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor\\nlife, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million\\nkilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the\\nSun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter\\njust a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.\\n\\n     Our planet\\'s rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give\\nrise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the\\natmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation\\ncoming from the Sun and other stars. Earth\\'s atmosphere protects\\nus from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can\\nstrike the surface. Active geological processes have left no\\nevidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon\\nafter it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the\\nother newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in\\nthe early days of the solar system.\\n\\n     From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our\\nhome planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was\\nlaunched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and\\ndiscovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen\\nradiation belts, surrounding Earth.\\n\\n     Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our\\nplanet\\'s magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by\\nthe solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously\\nejected from the Sun. We\\'ve learned that the magnetic field does\\nnot fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now\\nknow that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and\\nuneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and\\ncontracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the\\nupper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.\\n\\n     Besides affecting Earth\\'s weather, solar activity gives rise\\nto a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged\\nparticles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth\\'s magnetic\\nfield, they collide with air molecules above our planet\\'s\\nmagnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are\\nknown as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.\\n\\n     Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in\\nspace play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These\\nwatchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous\\nglobal monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and\\ncontributes to a better understanding of Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems.\\n\\n     From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey\\nEarth\\'s oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet\\'s\\nhealth. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided\\ntremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our\\nplanet in dangerous ways.\\n     \\n\\nThe Moon\\n\\n     The Moon is Earth\\'s single natural satellite. The first\\nhuman footsteps on an alien world were made by American\\nastronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless\\ncompanion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo\\nexpeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and\\nLunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.\\n\\n     NASA\\'s Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials\\nand data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the\\nlunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection\\nof rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)\\nand consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.\\n\\n     From this material and other studies, scientists have\\nconstructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.\\nRocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3\\nbillion years old. The first few million years of the Moon\\'s\\nexistence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.\\nAs a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into\\ndifferent kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids\\nand smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode\\nIsland or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created\\nbasins hundreds of kilometers across.\\n\\n     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four\\nbillion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,\\noverlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken\\nrock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to\\nmelt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers\\n(125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million\\nyears -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose\\nfrom inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the\\nsurface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas\\nthat Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,\\ncalled maria, meaning seas.\\n\\n     As far as we can tell, there has been no significant\\nvolcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.\\nSince then, the lunar surface has been altered only by\\nmicrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,\\nby the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and\\nastronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion\\nyears ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the\\none today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the\\nApollo crews will remain sharp and clear.\\n\\n     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories\\nattempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate\\nbody; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was\\ncaptured by our planet\\'s gravity, or it was the result of a\\ncollision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.\\nThe last theory has some good support but is far from certain.\\n     \\n\\nMars\\n\\n     Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar\\nsystem\\'s prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.\\nAstronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what\\nappeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These\\nobservations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led\\nto the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a\\nsystem of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson\\nWelles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction\\nclassic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed\\nin the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.\\n\\n     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to\\ndo with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet\\'s\\nsurface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might\\nsupport a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months\\nand cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.\\n\\n     So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.\\nFour Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one\\nplaced into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively\\nbefore the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.\\n\\n     Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,\\n1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the\\nsurface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the\\nplanet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring\\nchannels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.\\nMariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of\\n1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a\\ndiversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry\\natmosphere of carbon dioxide.\\n\\n     On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a\\nmission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The\\nspacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to\\nfind Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made\\nsurface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the\\nstorm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329\\npictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,\\nincluding evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across\\nthe surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.\\n\\n     In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft\\n-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from\\nKennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several\\nquestions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?\\nNobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was\\nhoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at\\nleast find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.\\n\\n     Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully\\ntouch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,\\nwhile the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos\\nsent back from the Chryse Planitia (\"Plains of Gold\") showed a\\nbleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the\\nlander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked\\nby rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives\\nthe sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia\\nPlanitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape\\nthan the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible\\ndunes.\\n\\n     The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking\\nLander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil\\nwere tested in three different experiments designed to detect\\nbiological processes. While some of the test results seemed to\\nindicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this\\nactivity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet\\'s soil\\nchemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the\\nViking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist\\nthere.\\n\\n     The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind\\nvelocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and\\npressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest\\ntemperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.\\n\\n     The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees\\nFahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2\\nsite during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at\\nthe two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but\\nbecause the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking\\nLander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably\\nwater-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.\\n\\n     The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily\\ncarbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small\\npercentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much\\nwater as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,\\nforming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around\\nthe slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning\\nfog can form in valleys.\\n\\n     There is evidence that in the past a denser martian\\natmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical\\nfeatures closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and\\nislands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.\\n\\n     Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and\\nirregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is\\npossible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too\\nclose to Mars and were captured by its gravity.\\n\\n     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins\\ntheir design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The\\nfirst to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on\\nJuly 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.\\nViking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut\\ndown because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on\\nAugust 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was\\nused up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.\\n\\n     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology\\nexperiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except\\nEarth. NASA\\'s Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in\\nSeptember 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian\\nenvironment and lead to human exploration of the red planet. \\n     \\n\\nAsteroids\\n\\n     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic\\nobjects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be\\nconsidered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as\\nasteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a\\nband or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have\\norbits that cross Earth\\'s path, and there is evidence that Earth\\nhas been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,\\nbest preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near\\nWinslow, Arizona.\\n\\n     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the\\nsolar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a\\nplanet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More\\nlikely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a\\nplanet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was\\ngathered into a single object, the object would be only about\\n1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the\\ndiameter of our Moon. \\n\\n     Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It\\nis estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be\\nphotographed through Earth-based telescopes.\\n\\n     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from\\nexamining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of\\nEarth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are\\ncalled meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at\\nhigh velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to\\nincinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the\\nmeteoroid does not burn up completely, what\\'s left strikes\\nEarth\\'s surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places\\nto look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.\\n\\n     Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of\\nsilicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and\\nnickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony\\nmeteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much\\nlike terrestrial rocks.\\n\\n     Since asteroids are material from the very early solar\\nsystem, scientists are interested in their composition.\\nSpacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found\\nthat the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are\\nseparated by very large distances.\\n\\n     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids\\nfor closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in\\nOctober 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to\\nJupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini\\nmissions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for\\nlaunch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini\\nmissions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space\\nAgency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as\\nwell as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.\\nOne day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw\\nmaterials.\\n     \\n\\nJupiter\\n\\n     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of\\nour solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,\\nUranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four\\nspacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these\\ncolossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter\\nwas the first port of call.\\n\\n     Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in\\nMarch 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid\\nbelt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In\\nDecember 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,\\nflying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet\\'s\\nbanded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1\\nand 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned\\nspectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites\\nduring flybys in 1979.\\n\\n     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of\\nliquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere\\ncomposed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice\\ncrystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps\\nphosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that\\ncharacterize Jupiter\\'s atmosphere.\\n\\n     It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases\\nreact to form organic molecules in the regions between the\\nplanet\\'s frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying\\nbelow. Because of Jupiter\\'s atmospheric dynamics, however, these\\norganic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.\\n\\n     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through\\ntelescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter\\'s\\natmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a\\nhigh-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction\\nopposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is\\nsurrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and\\nare sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a\\nmillion years old.\\n\\n     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter\\'s upper\\natmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth\\'s\\nnorthern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned\\nthe first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.\\n\\n     Largest of the solar system\\'s planets, Jupiter rotates at a\\ndizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The\\nmassive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey\\naround the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a\\nminiature solar system.\\n\\n     A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under\\nway. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once\\npast Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two\\nasteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into\\nJupiter\\'s cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo\\nOrbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close\\nto Jupiter\\'s large moons, exploring in detail what the two\\nPioneers and two Voyagers revealed.\\n     \\n\\nGalilean Satellites\\n\\n     In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and\\nspotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first\\ntime, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of\\ntheir discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the\\nGalilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily\\ntraded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs\\nreturned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these\\nplanet-sized satellites.\\n\\n     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission\\nwas the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.\\nVolcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world\\nother than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine\\nactive volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending\\nas far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon\\'s surface.\\n\\n     Io\\'s pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow\\nhues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to\\nthe surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this\\nsatellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the\\ngravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three\\nGalilean moons.\\n\\n     Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the\\nbrightest Galilean satellite. The moon\\'s surface displays a\\ncomplex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been\\nfractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa\\nhas been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --\\napparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered\\nby an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the\\ncold of space. Europa\\'s core is made of rock that sank to its\\ncenter.\\n\\n     Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and\\nCallisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest\\nsatellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury\\nand Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or\\nice and the rest rock. Ganymede\\'s surface has areas of different\\nbrightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of\\nthe moon\\'s interior and was deposited at various locations on the\\nsurface.\\n\\n     Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the\\nlowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large\\namounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the\\nmost heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity\\nduring its history has erased old craters except more impacts.\\n\\n     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be\\nperformed by the Galileo Orbiter.\\n     \\n\\nSaturn\\n\\n     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its\\nexquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is\\ncomposed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors\\nand wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn\\'s atmosphere\\nhas a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted\\nby high-altitude haze. Given Saturn\\'s somewhat placid-looking\\nappearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity\\nequatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100\\nmiles) per hour.\\n\\n     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11\\nsped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,\\nreturning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in\\nNovember 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that\\nrevealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn\\'s ring\\nsystem and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in\\nAugust 1981.\\n\\n     The rings are composed of countless low-density particles\\norbiting individually around Saturn\\'s equator at progressive\\ndistances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves\\npassing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely\\nin size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are\\nbright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.\\n\\n     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body\\nventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been\\ntorn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its\\ninterior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin\\nwith and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn\\'s gravity. A\\nthird possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions\\nwith larger objects orbiting the planet.\\n\\n     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each\\nother, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by\\nthe gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These\\ncomplex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets\\nthat make up the major rings.\\n\\n     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM\\ncar radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager\\nspacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are\\nbelieved to be coming from Saturn\\'s ring system rather than its\\natmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at\\nJupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth\\'s auroras near\\nSaturn\\'s poles.\\n\\n     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several\\nsatellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons\\nshepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn\\'s rings and the gaps\\nin the rings. Saturn\\'s 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from\\nimages taken by Voyager 2 in 1981. \\n\\n     Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based\\natmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth\\'s in\\ncomposition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and\\nVenus. Titan\\'s surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands\\nrising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.\\nUnfortunately, Voyager\\'s cameras could not penetrate the moon\\'s\\ndense clouds.\\n\\n     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be\\nconverting Titan\\'s methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in\\ncombination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter\\ncompound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may\\nbe similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth\\nbetween three and four billion years ago. However, Titan\\'s\\natmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit\\nprogress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.\\n\\n     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini\\nmission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will\\nalso deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into\\nTitan\\'s atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the\\nprobe as well as radar to peer through Titan\\'s clouds and will\\nspend years examining the Saturnian system.\\n     \\n\\nUranus\\n\\n     In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting\\nSaturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the\\nUranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about\\nUranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from\\nground observations since the planet\\'s discovery over two\\ncenturies ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.\\n\\n     Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the\\nsolar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of\\nPluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and\\nsouth poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing\\naround the solar system. During Voyager 2\\'s flyby, the south pole\\nfaced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an\\nEarth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the\\nsolar system.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 found that Uranus\\' magnetic field does not follow\\nthe usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,\\nthe field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet\\'s\\ncenter, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one\\nmagnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of\\nDjakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.\\n\\n     Uranus\\' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12\\npercent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water\\nvapor. The planet\\'s blue color occurs because methane in its\\natmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580\\nkilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud\\ntops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).\\n\\n     Uranus\\' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of\\nphotochemical \"smog\" believed to be a combination of acetylene,\\nethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the\\nplanet\\'s atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into\\nspace is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as \"electroglow.\"\\n\\n     Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus\\'\\ncloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and\\ndissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.\\nBeneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105\\nmiles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --\\nMiranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from\\n520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing\\na geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock\\nspheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past\\nactivity, including faulting and ice flows.\\n\\n     The most remarkable of Uranus\\' moons is Miranda. Its surface\\nfeatures high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and\\nwinding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,\\nafter the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with\\nanother body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which\\ncontains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments\\nfrom large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda\\napparently reformed with some of the material that had been in\\nits interior exposed on its surface.\\n\\n     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged\\n11. In contrast to Saturn\\'s rings, which are composed of bright\\nparticles, Uranus\\' rings are primarily made up of dark,\\nboulder-sized chunks.\\n     \\n\\nNeptune\\n\\n     Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system\\nwith an investigation of Neptune and the planet\\'s moons. On\\nAugust 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers\\n(3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.\\nDuring the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet\\'s\\natmosphere was more active than Uranus\\'. \\n\\n     Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the\\nsize of Earth, in Neptune\\'s atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter\\'s\\nGreat Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves\\nwestward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager\\n2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed\\nthe \"Scooter,\" as well as high-altitude clouds over the main\\nhydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any\\nplanet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per\\nhour.\\n\\n     Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen\\nand helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet\\'s core\\ncontains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the\\nother gas giants. Neptune\\'s distinctive blue appearance, like\\nUranus\\' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.\\n\\n     Neptune\\'s magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet\\'s\\nspin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is\\nsimilar to Uranus\\' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of\\nthe two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,\\nwhere the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the\\nelectrical properties of a metal. Earth\\'s magnetic field, on the\\nother hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only\\nslightly tilted and offset relative to its center.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune\\'s rings.\\nObservations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of\\nmaterial in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how\\nNeptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from\\nspreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected\\nthese arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.\\nA number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies\\nwere not spotted.\\n\\n     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in\\n1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new\\nmoons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since\\nProteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet\\'s\\nglare for observers on Earth.\\n\\n      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six\\ndays. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly\\ntowards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in\\nastronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian\\ngravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to\\naccompany the planet\\'s modest current rings.\\n\\n     Triton\\'s landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of\\nIo and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at\\nSaturn and Uranus. Triton\\'s mantle is probably composed of\\nwater-ice, but the moon\\'s crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and\\nmethane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of\\nterrain: the so-called \"cantaloupe\" terrain and a receding ice\\ncap. \\n\\n     Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the\\nfallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas\\nand dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers\\n(1 to 5 miles). Triton\\'s thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as\\nthick as Earth\\'s, has winds that carry the dark particles and\\ndeposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet\\nfound in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees\\nFahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other\\nobject spacecraft have so far visited.\\n     \\n\\nPluto\\n\\n     Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the\\neccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside\\nNeptune\\'s orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will\\nremain until March 1999. Pluto\\'s orbit is also highly inclined --\\ntilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.\\n\\n     Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a\\ncelestial snowball. The planet\\'s diameter is calculated to be\\napproximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the\\nsize of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto\\'s\\nsurface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin\\natmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet\\nmoves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto\\'s spin\\naxis is tipped by 122 degrees. \\n\\n     The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in\\n1978. Charon\\'s surface composition is different from Pluto\\'s: the\\nmoon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane\\nice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both\\nbodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto\\'s\\nand Charon\\'s rotational period and Charon\\'s period of revolution\\nare all 6.4 Earth days. \\n\\n     Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is\\ncurrently exploring the possibility of such a mission.\\n     \\n\\nComets\\n\\n     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a\\nvisit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and\\nmetallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets\\nare the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only\\nfar from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a\\nloose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching\\nperhaps halfway to the nearest star.\\n\\n     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are\\ngravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close\\nto the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer\\nplanets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually\\nwarm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner\\nplanets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself\\nis irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally\\nof water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar\\nto those composing the moons of the giant planets.\\n\\n     As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma\\nor cloud-like \"head\" that can measure tens of thousands of\\nkilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the\\nSun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes\\non this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving\\nrise to the comet\\'s \"tails.\" Gases and ions are blown directly\\nback from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.\\nAs the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are\\nleft behind in a curved arc.\\n\\n     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in\\neffect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.\\nThe tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in\\nlength, but the total amount of material contained in this\\ndramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --\\nfrom the Latin cometa, meaning \"long-haired\" -- are essentially\\ndramatic light shows.\\n\\n     Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but\\nothers have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close\\nencounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter\\nvisitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return\\nto the inner solar system.\\n\\n     Halley\\'s Comet is the most famous example of a relatively\\nshort period comet, returning on an average of once every 76\\nyears and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus\\' orbit.\\nConfirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular\\nvisitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,\\nbecause he plotted the comet\\'s orbit and predicted its return,\\nbased on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name\\nbecame part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet\\nreturned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to\\nsee it.\\n\\n     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes\\ncomparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent\\nappearance, Halley\\'s Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million\\nkilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was\\nvisible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern\\nhemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so\\nbright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.\\nHistorically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens\\nand have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.\\n\\n     The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will\\nbecome the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and\\nremain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF\\nwill observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing\\nsunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and\\nform a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at\\nhigh speed; the first was NASA\\'s International Cometary Explorer\\nin 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet\\nand the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by\\nHalley\\'s Comet in 1986.\\n     \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\n     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of\\nspace through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had\\nonly one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,\\nspaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our\\nneighbors in space. \\n\\n     We have learned more about our solar system and its members\\nthan anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated\\nspacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets\\nbeyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large\\nas small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar\\nenvironment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of\\nbodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for\\ngenerations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange\\nand beautiful places and objects.\\n\\n     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar\\nsystem has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and\\nmeteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called\\ncomparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,\\nmoons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and\\nsimilarities, we are learning more about the origin and history\\nof these bodies and the solar system as a whole.\\n\\n     We are also gaining insight into Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by\\ninvestigating the Sun\\'s activity and its influence throughout the\\nsolar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and\\nprocesses on Earth.\\n\\n     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated\\nspacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission\\nis mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach\\nthe Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future\\nmissions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid\\nbelt.\\n\\n     We can also look forward to the time when humans will once\\nagain set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not\\nbeen back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being\\nformulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the\\nhuman exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian\\noutposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a\\nlunar base or a martian colony!\\n\\n- end -\\n     \\n',\n",

Hmm...let\\'s see: \\n\\n  Iraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that \\n  led to the invasion, as the CIA correctly predicted (and pretended to \\n  be surprised not to know). \\n  It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid. \\n\\n  What would I have done: Most Muslims would choose 300 dead Kuwaitis   over \\n  200,000 dead Iraqis and 1000 dead Kuwaitis. The first case would happen \\n  if no western intervention happened, and the second case was a direct \\n  or indirect result of western envolvement. \\n\\nPossibly, if 200,000 Iraqis had indeed died, but this number is based on\\nGreenpeace estimates.  Greenpeace had compromised its alleged\\nimpartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmental\\nconsequences of Allied miiltary action, while initially *completely*\\nignoring Iraq\\'s horrible environmental crimes, starting with the dumping\\nof millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf at Ahmadi to the blowing of\\nover 700 oil wells.  What is the real number?  There has been a lot of\\nwork on this in the last two years, none of it reported as the\\nGreenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about.  The real\\nnumber seems to be around 10,000, on the same order as the number of\\nKuwaitis killed, tortured and kidnapped during the occupation.  I\\'ve\\nincluded an article I recently posted below, but this is really old\\nnews.  Independent Television News reported a figure around 15,000 only\\na few months after the war, but it was hardly reported. \\n\\nFor the Allies to have killed 200,000 Iraqis, they would have had to\\nkill twice the *total* number of Iraqis in Kuwait. \\n\\nThe favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war at\\nMutla\\'.  This was yet another example of the American and European media\\nplaying into the hands of Iraq and its de facto allies.     The\\ndestruction of the Iraqi convoy at Mutla\\' was portrayed as an all-out\\nslaughter.  This is simply not true.  The head and tail of the convoy\\nwas bombed initially, resulting in a lot of casualties at these points. \\n Before bombers came back, most of the rest of the Iraqi soldiers fled\\non foot. \\n\\nFurthermore, your estimates of Kuwaiti war dead if Allies hadn\\'t invaded\\nis completely ridiculous.  You have acknowledged (certainly implicitly) \\n that Saddam is a barbarous brute.  You have acknowledged the hundreds\\nof thousands he has been responible for killing *in his own country*. \\nYou *know* that the man he appointed as governor of Kuwait,  Ali Majid,\\nwas his most brutal henchman, presiding over the near genocide of the\\nKurds  in the late 80\\'s and, more recently, the Shi\\'a.    Yet, when it\\ncomes to his treatment of Kuwaitis, he is an angel.  In your estimate,\\nhe would\\'ve killed *fewer* than he already had when the war started. \\nWhat a joke! \\n\\n\\nAPn  03/09 0006  Iraq War Dead \\n\\nCopyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved. \\n\\nBy NICK LUDINGTON \\n Associated Press Writer \\n   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After the Persian Gulf War ended, the world was\\ntold that \\nas many as 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed. At one point, even Baghdad put \\nthe toll that high, as did the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency in private. \\n   But U.S. officials have been backpedaling ever since, even though the \\nPentagon has yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public. \\nNow, one former DIA analyst says the number of Iraqi troops killed may\\nhave been \\nas low as 1,500. \\n   That conclusion by John Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the \\nquarterly magazine Foreign Policy, represents the lowest estimate yet\\nfrom U.S. \\ndefense sources. \\n   The revisions suggesting a less devastating Iraqi toll fit a pattern of \\nvastly moderated U.S. military claims in the months after the war ended.\\nClaims \\nfor a number of U.S. weapons also were scaled down. \\n   Despite the dramatic videotapes of successful weaponry or the shocking \\npictures of Iraq\\'s disastrous retreat from Kuwait, arguments have continued \\nunabated about what really happened in the Gulf War. \\n   Heidenrich is not the first to question the Iraqi death toll numbers that \\noriginally were aired. More that a year ago, Air Force Lt. Gen. Charles\\nHorner, \\nthe commander of the air campaign in the Gulf War, said he believed the Iraqi \\nmilitary death toll was fewer than 10,000 for the entire war. \\n   The Pentagon itself still refuses to provide an estimate of the number of \\nIraqis who died in the 42-day war against the U.S.-led coalition in\\nJanuary and \\nFebruary 1991. On Monday, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Joe Gradisher\\nreiterated \\npast statements that \"there just isn\\'t a number,\" that is credible. \\n   But some current internal estimates range from 8,000 to 25,000 Iraqi troops \\nkilled, said one analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity, who is familiar \\nwith the Pentagon\\'s reports. \\n   Allied deaths were put at 146 Americans, 35 by friendly fire; 24 British, 9 \\nby American fire; 2 Frenchmen, 1 Italian and 39 among various Arab allies. \\n   Of the postwar reassessments, the most widely publicized was the Army\\'s \\nreluctant acknowledgement, months later, that its touted Patriot air defense \\nsystem was nowhere near so effective as claimed against Iraq\\'s Scud missiles. \\nThe Bush administration initially claimed an almost perfect record for the \\nPatriot; last spring it revised the hit ratio to 60 percent. \\n   The success record of the Navy\\'s Tomahawk high-tech cruise missile used \\nagainst targets in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq also turned out to be more \\nmodest than initially indicated by the Pentagon. \\n   The first Iraqi casualty figures to surface after the war came in a\\nMay 1991 \\nreport by the environmental group Greenpeace, which said 100,000 to 120,000 \\nIraqi soldiers were killed. It estimated that 5,000 to 15,000 Iraqi civilians \\nwere also killed. \\n   The same month, published reports said the Defense Intelligence Agency \\nestimated 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded in the\\nair and \\nground campaigns -- although the agency qualified that by saying the estimate \\ncould be off by as much as 50 percent in either direction. \\n   But as more information became available, those figures gradually were \\nrevised downward. \\n   The House Armed Services Committee staff estimated 9,000 dead and 17,000 \\nwounded after a review last year. \\n   But Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the quarterly Foreign\\nPolicy, \\nestimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensives\\nas low as \\n1,500 -- with about 3,000 wounded. \\n   Heidenrich based the conclusion in his article on the number of\\nbodies found \\nand buried by U.S. troops -- 577 -- and on prisoner of war interviews.\\nHe noted \\nthat only about 2,000 of 69,000 Iraqi prisoners of war were wounded. \\n   Based on the calculation that about half as many wounded escaped as were \\ncaptured, he put the number of wounded at about 3,000. Using a conservative \\nratio of one dead to two wounded, applicable to Third World armies like\\nIraq, he \\nset battlefield deaths at 1,500. \\n   \"Maybe the figures are too low,\" he wrote. \"Maybe the real death toll\\non the \\nbattlefield was 2,000 or 3,000 or even 6,000. Even then, the evidence\\nsuggests a \\ndeath toll of well below 100,000 -- or even 10,000.\" \\n   In an interview, he said the 100,000 figure was obviously off base\\nbecause it \\nwould mean that virtually all the Iraqi soldiers in the Kuwait theater of \\noperations were casualties. \\n   He said today\\'s bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology, \\nbut rather the drawn-out conflicts such as those in Yugoslavia and Somalia. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n',\n",

So the facts to observe are those which\\npertain to what questions you\\'re asking.

And you can say that you\\'re looking at a signal instead of\\nlistening to noise,  but the beauty of science is that it takes both\\ninto account (the totality aspect).  For science to say that light is\\na wave and NOT a particle (or vice versa) would be to ignore the total\\nessence that is light (which is based upon the agreed upon definitions).\\n\\nWhy even have definitions?

Of course the apocryphal books were received (by some),\\ncollected (or else we would not have them), read and used (and they still are,\\nin the Catholic and Orthodox churches).\\n\\n: On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.\\n\\nThis is demonstrably false.\\n\\n: To quote Unger\\'s Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:\\n: 1.

They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices\\n: which are at variance with sacred Scripture.\\n\\n\"False\" by whose interpretation?  Those churches that accept them find no\\ncontradiction with the rest of scripture.  \\n\\n: 3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of\\n: subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.\\n\\nThis is a purely subjective evaluation.  The apocryphal books demonstrate\\nthe same categories and forms of writing found in the other scriptures.\\n(In fact, one could argue that the apocryphal \"Additions to the Book of\\nEsther\" act rather to bring the \"unscripturelike\" book of Esther more into\\nline with other books.)\\n\\n: 4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine\\n: Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and\\n: poetic and religious feeling.\\n\\nHave you ever read the Wisdom of Ben Sira or the Wisdom of Solomon?  They\\nexhibit every bit as much \"poetic and religious feeling\" as Psalms or\\nProverbs.\\n\\n[deletions]\\n\\n: How do you then view the words: \"I warn everyone who  hears the\\n: words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to\\n: them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.\\n: And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will\\n: take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the\\n: holy city\" (Rev 22.18-9)\\n: Surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions.\\n\\nThese words clearly were meant to refer to the book of Revelation alone,\\nnot to the whole body of scripture.  Revelation itself was accepted very\\nlate into the canon.  The church simply did not see it as having a primary\\nrole of any kind in identifying and limiting scripture.\\n\\n: It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus\\' attitude. He had no\\n: argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John\\n: 10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus \\n: that in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the \\n: OT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51\\n: taking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say\\n: Genesis to Malachi) as Scripture.\\n\\nJesus does not refer to the canon for the simple reason that in his day,\\nthe canon had not been established as a closed collection.  The books\\nof the apocrypha were part of the Septuagint (which was the Bible of\\nthe early church).  The Hebrew canon was not closed until 90 c.e.\\nThe Torah (Pentateuch/ \"Law\") was established in Jesus\\' day, as were\\nthe Prophets (with the _exclusion_ of Daniel).  The Writings, however,\\nwere still in flux.  Jesus does not refer to the Writings, only to the\\nPsalms, which were part of them.  The books of the apocrypha were all\\npart of the literature that was eventually sifted and separated.\\n\\nTo argue that Jesus is referring to the Jewish canonical order in Luke 11:51\\nis weak at best; he is not quoting scripture, but telling a chronological\\nstory.  And, as mentioned above, the Hebrew canon (especially in the\\npresent order) did not exist as such in Jesus\\' day.\\n\\nrevdak@netcom.com\\n',\n",

Does anone have any information\\n\\nI\\'m not sure that this condition is \"recognised\" anywhere (in the\\nsense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries\\nbetween it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic\\nfeatures, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.\\n\\nPost-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease\\nby clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities\\nare mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of\\nongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of\\ndeclining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks.\\nMusculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless\\ncontributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows\\nmuscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old\\ndenervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit\\naction potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation\\n(fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation\\nwith reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active\\ndenervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme\\nstaining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.\\n\\nPost-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically\\nevident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio,\\nthe patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one\\nyear to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio\\nbefore who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among\\npolio survivors than among people who never had polio.\\n\\nThe cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little\\nevidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or\\ndestructive immunologic response to virus antigen.\\n\\nThere is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have\\nanything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells,\\nmotor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than\\npatients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration.\\nBoth groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason\\nfor these \"acute\" changes in a \"chronic\" disease (old polio) is\\nunknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge\\nnumbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several\\nyears.\\n\\nThere are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio\\nsyndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny\\ndeterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe\\npolio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain.\\nThey also tend to score higher on depression scales of\\nneuropsychologic tests.\\n\\nMy take on this (I\\'m sure some will disagree):  after recovery from\\nsevere polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons,\\nligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or\\ndegenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing\\npain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads\\nto progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am\\nperhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS\\npatient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe\\nthat PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than\\nnon-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but\\nwithout PPS complaints).\\n---\\n .

Chaihorsky) wrote:\\n\\n[A] David --\\n\\n[A] We can go throwing flames at each other -\\n[A] nothing is easier. Why do not you just try to\\n[A] see the situation from a different prospective?\\n\\nNot taking sides leaves one in a state of perpetual indecision because both \\nsides in this issue have their own logic at any given time. As an Armenian I \\nam partisan -- by definition. However, this does give me the license to lie, \\ncover-up, or revise events under question as we have read on UseNet in postings \\nby agents of the Turkish government. I understand both sides of the issue, but \\nthis does not mean I will advocate both sides when it suits me. Such a \\nposition would make me a hypocrite. I am also not being paid by agents of \\nTurkey nor Azerbaijan as are many proponents of the Azeri side. I refer to \\nagents such as Captioline International Group, Ltd., being paid in excess of \\n$30,000/month by Azerbaijan. I state my case unencumbered by such advocacy or \\nprostitution. \\n\\n[A] You do not have to change your mind for that - \\n[A] just (as if you are playing chess) ask yourself -\\n[A] what if? \\n[A] What if your tone is so offensive that one type of\\n[A] people loose control and start to erratically insult\\n[A] you, and others emotionally detach themselves from\\n[A] you writings and are not engaging in the discussion \\n[A] with you?\\n\\nMy tone is not offensive. If people are offended by what I say than I just\\nmay be too bad. This conflict, as is human conflict in general, is rather \\nbleak and is surrounded by the most barbaric actions of man. Given such \\nconditions, dispassion is rather difficult, and artificial at best. This does \\nnot mean that discussion is out of the question. No conflict is ever resolved \\nwithout discussion.\\n\\n[A] I\\'ll try first. Recently I received a message from\\n[A] a Russian guy who frequently visited Baku that \\n[A] approximately after 1986 the old situation when \\n[A] there were no anti-Armenian press had changed and\\n[A] the press became very anti-Armenian and average\\n[A] Azeri became an Armenian-hater. This is devastation \\n[A] news for me because one of my cornerstones was the fact\\n[A] that I MYSELF SAW ARMENIANS IN BAKU AMONG OTHER ETHNIC\\n[A] GROUPS AND SAW, OR HEARD, OR READ NOTHING THAT WOULD\\n[A] SEEM LIKE HATRED. You might say that an outsider never \\n[A] sees, but by that time I was myself victimized as a member\\n[A] of a minority by Russians and knew what to look for and\\n[A] what innocent sign or remark might signify.\\n\\nI am sure. The Soviet Union effectively froze in time all ethnic problems it\\ncreated or was brewing just after WWI. During the Soviet reign, officials \\ntended to shape the frozen conflicts in such a way so when thawed, they \\nwould serve the purposes of the internal policies of the Soviet Union or\\nsuccessor states.\\n\\n[A] Again - one of my cornerstones show cracks. I will investigate.\\n[A] Another cornerstone of my thought is that Armenia started\\n[A] hostilities against Azeris in Armenia before anything happened\\n[A] in Sumgait (not at all I am trying to justify violence in Sumgait\\n[A] or anywhere else - I bow my head with grief and respect and \\n[A] did demand and will laways demand that criminals be severely\\n[A] punished according to the law of the land.\\n[A] I would like you to supply me with the information about that.\\n[A] Does or does not the hostilities began in Armenia? Was thousands\\n[A] od Azeris thrown out of their homes and forced to leave Armeina\\n[A] before Sumgait or not? \\n\\nSumgait took place in February of 1988. The Azeris of Armenia were expelled\\nin the late fall of 1988. It took the entire summer of 1988 for the\\nsituation to get so bad for Azeris in Armenian that the Russians had to\\nevacuate them. I refer specifically to _Human Rights Violations in Armenia\\nand Azerbaijan_, A report of Pax Christi Netherlands 12 September 1991. Also,\\none need only read the newspaper to verify this. \\n\\nYou do realize, perhaps unknowingly -- perhaps not -- you are mirroring \\nTurkish propaganda and lies regarding what took place when and where first!\\n\\n[A] Second - in your last message you used a very terrifying\\n[A] phrase - \"Artificial borders\" when you were talking about \\n[A] Armenian. Do you believe that Armenia have righteous territorial\\n[A] claims? Do you believe that Armenia has rights to the lands that\\n[A] currently belong to other countries? \\n[A] Do you believe that this is stricktly Armenian priviledge or\\n[A] everybody should start reclaiming what once was theirs?\\n\\nI had addressed this issue several time before -- perhaps I was not clear. The\\ncurrent borders of Armenia were not set as a result of the consolidation of\\na high Armenian culture. Today\\'s Armenia is about 1/10 the land mass that\\nsustained Armenians for nearly three millennia. It was the natural Armenian\\nboundaries that sustained Armenians -- not the current boundaries. The current\\nborders of Armenia would never support a society nor sustain its growth. Does \\nthis mean that Armenia should expand? It might, if Armenia is not allowed to \\nintegrate into the region. If this past winter is any indication of the future \\nstatus of Armenia, then Armenia must do what it will to survive. \\nUnfortunately, in my opinion, and you can quote me on this, as I am sure you \\nand others will, the combined forces of both Armenia and Karabakh should have \\ntaken Karabakh and the land in between in a matter of weeks in late 1991. This \\nwould avoided all the pain and suffering both sides endured and would remove a \\ntool of Russian influence in the Caucasus. You may call me a war-monger -- so \\nbe it. If Armenians don\\'t defend their right to live on the land they live on, \\nthose rights will be taken away. The Azeris should not have the right to \\nremove these Armenians, but given the first chance to, they will, as was \\nproven throughout all of Azerbaijan. If the Soviet Union didn\\'t break apart, \\ntoday Karabakh would be emptied of Armenians. Operation Ring, started in early \\n1991 emptied the northern 1/3 of Karabakh of Armenians, but the operation was \\nsuspended by the disillusionment of the Soviet Union. Lucky for the Armenians! \\nIf the Azeris feel as though they can expel all the Armenians of Karabakh, the \\nArmenians will resist, if the Armenians can\\'t live under Azeri oppression, \\nthen they will fight for the right to live their lives free from such \\noppression. If this means these Armenian demand independence, I support such a \\nmove. If you can\\'t understand this, as an Azeri, that is truly unfortunate. \\nUntil this is understood by the Gray Wolves in Baku, more young Azeri men will \\ndie in the pursuit of the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Karabakh \\nArmenians.\\n \\n[A] Third thing - you keep saying about 3000 years of Armenian presence\\n[A] in Karabakh. What exactly you mean by that? That there were Armenians\\n[A] 3000 years ago in Karabah? Only Armenians? Or among other nations?\\n[A] I saw (SAW) a Russian tax map of Karabah with all the landowners and\\n[A] occupant names on it (the map was surveyed by Russian Army in 1810.\\n[A] Would you believe that there were almost exclusivly Achmeds and Hu-\\n[A] sseins? I also saw Armenian names, but the absolute majority of the\\n[A] population was Muslim. If I am wrong - give me your sources, but\\n[A] please, let us keep the rule that we only pay attention to third\\n[A] party sources.\\n[A] There are Russian diplomatic documents about the mission of the\\n[A] Russian famous writer and diplomat Griboedov whose mission in Iran\\n[A] was protection of Armenians that were persecuted by Persians and\\n[A] RELOCATION these Armenians inside Russian Empire. According to\\n[A] the Russian tax documents that was the time when the population of\\n[A] Karabakh became predominantly (in some places) Armenian.\\n\\nKarabakh, or Artsakh as it is known in Armenian (and Urartian) is the only\\npiece of Armenia that has a continuous Armenian occupation, from the\\ntransformation of the Urartians to Armenians, nearly 3,000 years ago. You\\nrefer to Russian and Muslim rulers over Karabakh, not the population! You\\nsurely must know the rules of Muslim landownership over non-Muslims.\\n\\n[A] You write in your letter that \"Azeris were shelling Stepanakert which\\n[A] now is almost completely destroyed\"  David - is it fair to say that \\n[A] Stepanakert was destroyed by Azeris? There is that fine line between\\n[A] propaganda and personal view, however bizzarre that view is - YOU KNOW\\n[A] AS WELL AS ANYBODY WHO SAW TV IN THE TIMES OF THE EARTHQUAKE - that \\n[A] Stepanakert was almost completely devastated by the quake. \\n[A] But may be you believe that the damage from Azeri shelling is greater\\n[A] than the damage from the quake? OK, no problem, AS LONG AS YOU MENTION\\n[A] THE QUAKE. \\n\\nAs I wrote in a short response to you regarding this earlier. You may be\\nconfusing Spitak with Stepanakert. There were no effects of the earthquake \\nin Karabakh.\\n\\n[A] I want dialog. I am not interested in mud-throwing. And in dialog I want\\n[A] honest opinions (one might be wrong, but one MUST be honest). Honest \\n[A] opinions may be based on emotions but in this case one should indicate\\n[A] that. But mostly we are looking for information based opinions.\\n[A] I always ask myself - why I think that? Is it because I was told so\\n[A] bt so many people that it became a truth? Or I read a book? Who wrote\\n[A] it? What was his/her intentions/interests/whatever? \\n\\nFine. I stated my opinions and the reasons for them. If you put into action \\nwhat you just stated above, you would understand my outrage at the posting of \\nFarid who just posted items from some Islamic conference, etc., and just left \\nit at that. He has done his numerous times. At least I responded to that \\nposting, and was outraged that Farid simply copies other people`s text, posts \\nit -- yet does not display the courage be responsible for what he posts. One \\ncan always stand behind the facade of claiming what I write is polemic, \\nhowever, as a result such irresponsibility I am free to make a claim of \\ncowardice. \\n\\n[A] Please, give me sources, facts, titles of the books of third party\\n[A] writers, etc.\\n\\nI believe I have, and can support what I claim. I don\\'t make up history, nor\\ndo I have to! I have done enough research regarding Turkish Genocide Apology \\nto revisionism from good scholarship, and I will never fall victim to \\nbottomless pit of making claims without a solid basis.\\n\\n[A] And please, answer my questions in the beginning of the letter.\\n\\n[A] And for you Armenian friends who do not like what I write - \\n[A] sorry, but these are my thoughts and it is very disturbing\\n[A] that you like people when they say what you like and dislike\\n[A] them when they say something that you do not like. \\n\\nAlex, I stated my friends and associates where rather surprised as the tone of\\nyour posting considering the fact that I had categorized you as an open-minded \\nAzeri. Perhaps I was fooled by you? Perhaps I should believe that you are like \\n\"all Azeris when it comes to Armenians\". I chose not to accept such a \\nstatement. They were not surprised at what you said so much as it was coming \\nfrom you, somebody from which they expected otherwise. You see, you didn\\'t add \\nanything to the issue, which was the expectation, only conforming old\\nsuspicions.\\n\\n[A] For me\\n[A] it is most inportant that a guy makes a honest effort to find\\n[A] the truth. If so, he/she might have whatever opinion he/she\\n[A] wants. I believe that telling people the truth, seeking it - is \\n[A] far more noble than just support your race because it is yours.\\n[A] That is a way of animals, primitive tribes and criminal societies.\\n[A] Civilized people seek truth.\\n\\n[A] Cheers,\\n\\n[A] Alex\\n\\nIf you think I am intellectually dishonest, please demonstrate it. As I stated\\nabove, I am partisan on this issue, thus expect me to take a stand in the\\ninterest of the Armenians, not against Armenians. This stance should not seem \\nstrange to you. I am not here to generate excuses for Armenians wanting to \\nlive on the land they live on, and wanting to live in peace. If Armenians must \\ndie for what they believe in, and make ultimate sacrifice, you had better \\nlisten to them. No amount of rhetoric -- not from Yerevan, Baku, the CSCE, nor \\npaid prostitutes in Washington -- will convince Karabakh Armenians otherwise! \\n\\n\\n-- \\nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"Armenia has not learned a lesson in\\nS.D.P.A.

Alexander Mogilny led the\\ncomeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at\\n3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots\\non goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and\\nLaFontaine all night.\\n\\nRoster move:\\n\\nAndre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy\\nscratch.\\n\\nLines:\\n\\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\\nBeranek-Brind\\'Amour-Dineen\\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\\nFaust-Acton-Brown\\n\\nGalley-Bowen\\nYushkevich-Hawgood\\nCarkner-McGill\\n\\nTommy Soderstrom\\n\\nGame Summary:\\n\\nSay, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that\\nwoman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!\\n\\nThe FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have\\nbeen shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the\\nfirst period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday\\nwhen they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that\\nhe was getting bored back there...\\n\\nMark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After\\nBuffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards\\nto Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead\\nto Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed\\nthe puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and\\nin on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his\\nstick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the\\nright past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and\\nGarry should turn down their assists :-).\\n\\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong\\nand kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive\\nstruggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when\\nTerry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into\\nthe boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not\\na terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got\\na post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.\\n\\nKeith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to\\ngive the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league\\ndidn\\'t allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a\\ngood scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards\\nthe end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept\\nmissing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give\\nthe Sabres another power play, but they couldn\\'t get anything going and the\\nfans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots\\nwere 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.\\n\\nMike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was\\ndisappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered\\na rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the\\nseason went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was\\nRuss Farwell\\'s trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed\\nSnider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they\\'d do\\nit all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for\\nnext year he said that it\\'s Russ\\' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the\\nend of the season. He feels that they\\'re 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.\\nHe expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title\\nthe following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based\\non the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.\\n\\nHe\\'s very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \"outstanding\"). Happy with\\nthe current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux\\nof Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.\\nSeemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there\\nwas a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in\\nfour years if there was a consensus.\\n\\nThe Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May\\ntook a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble\\ngetting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving\\nthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres\\nblue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed\\nacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the\\ntop of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling\\nthrough the slot. Fuhr didn\\'t know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the\\nrace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.\\n\\nThen Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line\\nand went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was\\nall over it.\\n\\nThe FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.\\nViacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when\\nBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer\\ntook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln\\'t\\nget started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the\\nFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and\\nheaded the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind\\'Amour hustled ahead to\\nmake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top\\nof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John\\nMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.\\n\\nBut the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to\\njust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all\\nover them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through\\nSoderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that\\nmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as\\nhe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.\\nMistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried\\nabout A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right\\nnext to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and\\nmistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the\\npuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn\\'t even swing his\\nstick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks\\nend for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.\\n\\nLindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking\\nminor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get\\nset up quickly, but couldn\\'t get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued\\nto keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.\\nThings evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill\\nallowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a\\nfaceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of\\nhim. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and\\nthat meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,\\n7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.\\n\\nThe FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long\\nthey could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to\\nLedyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by\\nSoderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of\\nthe net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had\\nmoved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving\\nat the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net\\nat 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to\\nput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.\\n\\nThe FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek\\nwas strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the\\nneutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS\\nblue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the\\nleft circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at\\n18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between\\nthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off\\nangles...\\n\\nThat was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.\\n\\nInto the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the\\nFLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in\\nthe slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until\\nhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he\\nhit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.\\n\\nThan an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood\\nuntouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under\\nSoderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,\\nhorn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange\\nreason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they\\ncould be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade\\nthat went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria\\nfor scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...\\n\\nDave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS\\ncould not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through,\\nbut were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck\\nfrom a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across\\nto Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net\\njust inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,\\nbut twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing\\npuck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.\\n\\nBut the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive\\nleft corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate\\nout, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew\\nin, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom\\'s 5 hole for his 76th at\\n5:24 to tie the game at 4.\\n\\nThen Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up\\nin the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in\\nthe middle. While Brind\\'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the\\nline and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek\\'s glove side at 6:44.\\n\\nPlay started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.\\nThe FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind\\'Amour and Ledyard went\\nafter it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated\\nto the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing\\nthrough the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over\\nthe blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season\\nfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th\\nof the season.\\n\\nThen Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres\\npower play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the\\nchances on the FLYERS resulting power play.\\n\\nPlay went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to\\nmake some big saves. The Sabres weren\\'t able to pull Hasek as time was running \\nout as the FLYERS wouldn\\'t allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.\\nFinally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left\\ncorner and Brind\\'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found\\nDineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the\\nright of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton\\nchipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48\\non his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,\\nand the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the\\ngame.\\n\\nSo another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn\\'t been tested much\\nin his last couple of starts.

Press conference next week\\nMessage-ID: <allan.735596137@swanlake>\\nDate: 23 Apr 93 20:15:37 GMT\\nSender: news@cs.UAlberta.CA (News Administrator)\\nOrganization: University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada\\nLines: 23\\nNntp-Posting-Host: swanlake.cs.ualberta.ca\\n\\n\\nI heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton.\\nOiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference\\nnext week. While the exact details are not known, it is believed\\nto concern the Oiler's future.\\n\\nRumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement\\nwith Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference,\\nPocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that\\nthe deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to\\nrenegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium.\\n\\nNorthlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier,\\nbut the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington.\\n\\nAs for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly\\nsupportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market\\nteam, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems\\nthat the team had this year, they still brought in more fans\\nthan many teams in larger cities did. On the other hand, if\\nthe team does move, there is no place more deserving than\\nHamilton. Of course, how would that affect the grand\\nrealignment scheme of Bettman? \\n\",\n",

Does\\nthis mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder\\nbecause he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent\\nsupporter?\\n\\nOne of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system\\nwas far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party\\nitself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was\\nnoone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not\\noriginaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it\\nuntil his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged\\nupon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of \\nhis supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the\\nold guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications\\nof their rhetoric. \\n\\nThis is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must\\nbe considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one \"race\"\\nof people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of\\nhumanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome,\\nthe gas chambers of Auschwitz.\\n\\nThe NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who\\nlead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the\\nevil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating.\\nHitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego\\ncult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however\\nmean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and\\nhis propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can\\nproduce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be \\nemphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between\\na govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to \\ngovern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the\\nlatter as a \"strong\" government since most displays of strength are made\\nnecessary by an essential weakness.\\n\\nIt is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they\\namoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the\\nsame manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause\\nof morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their\\nlogic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties\\nsuch as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert\\nthe truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates\\nof a system that would commit genocide. \\n\\nThe conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is\\ninescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let\\nthe conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that\\nwere basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of\\nthe concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly\\ndoes not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.\\n\\nNo matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon \\nelection those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit.\\nIf this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made\\nthe pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates\\na dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many\\nin government politics is a method of providing a justification for\\ntheir own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A \\nrhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the\\ncontinued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the\\nessential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli\\nwhich has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important\\nto realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right\\nand those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement\\nof popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice.\\nIn the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through\\ntheir assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.\\n\\nIt is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics\\nof political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The\\nleaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do\\nso voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a \\ntask without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of\\nones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore\\nin taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole\\nbefore personal concerns, even of personal security.\\n\\nAlthough it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred\\nand an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit\\ngenocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of\\nthe system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility\\nof changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to \\ncontrol a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot \\naffect the system.\\n\\n\\nPhill Hallam-Baker\\nPhill Hallam-Baker\\n',\n",

This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\\nof the Copt-Net Newsletter :\\n\\nUnder the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed\\nto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played\\nleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak\\nabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the\\nEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said\\nthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\\ntime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\\nstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor\\nMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.\\nDioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\\nwas clear: \"You have nothing to do with the Church.\"  These political motives\\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was\\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in\\nmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only\\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\\n\\nThe Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant\\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\\nwhich was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two\\nnatures \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\\nwithout confusion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \"did not separate\\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (also from  the declaration of faith\\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\\n\\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\\nChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\\nindependent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn\\'t  quite go the\\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \"semantic\" differences between\\nall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\\nsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \"To the  Coptic Church, faith is\\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\\nterminology are of  little importance to us.\"  Throughout this  century,  the\\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has\\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a\\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\\nEvangelical Churches.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\\nwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\\nMonophysitism.\\n\\nPeace,\\n\\nNabil\\n\\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\\n    \\'-------------------------------------------------------------\\'\\n\\n[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\\nis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As\\nAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were\\nactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil\\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\\nheretical probably aren\\'t.\\n\\nChalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and\\nAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree\\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course\\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\\nrejected who didn\\'t intend heresy, but simply used language that was\\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have\\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are\\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This\\nposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also\\na remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called\\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\\nNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from\\nwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his\\nheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of\\nthe Antiochene tradition.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New  \\nZealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of  \\nit, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).  \\nThrough this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved  \\nin the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation  \\nhardware as the very best a \\'real\\' flyer could ask for. My favourite  \\ncomputer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both  \\npast and present. \\n\\nI became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all  \\nmilitary activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition  \\nto God\\'s commandments to love one another, especially one\\'s enemies.\\n\\nDuring the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to  \\nthe reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation  \\ntechnology I so admire - The F117A \\'Stealh\\' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16  \\nstrike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy  \\nsimulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam\\'s  \\nbio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his  \\nMig\\'s in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful  \\ngame. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.  \\nOne only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact  \\nof war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a  \\npilot is simply a \\'target\\'. Dead civilians are \\'collateral damage\\'. These  \\neuphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose  \\nsupport are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to  \\nlook at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.\\n\\nNow we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and  \\nthe prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in  \\nthe former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of  \\nSarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry \\'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,  \\nhas caused me to rethink where I stand on \\'justifiable\\' war.\\n\\nI will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say  \\n- Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut  \\nreactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality  \\nhistory brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for  \\nmy reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I  \\nam working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.\\n\\n1. The Second World War\\n\\t- Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped.\\n\\t- Massive civilian casualties on both sides \\n\\t\\t- Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki\\n\\t- Probably justifiable.\\n\\n2. Korean war\\n\\t- Political expansionism by North Korea, basically\\n\\t  communism vs. capitalism.\\n\\t- Probably not justifiable.\\n\\n3. Vietnam\\n\\t- As above, worsened by US involvement.\\n\\n4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.\\n\\t- Genocide by Khmer Rouge.\\n\\t- Probably justifiable.\\n\\n5. Iraq (Desert Storm)\\n\\t- Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply\\n\\t- Other factors such as genocide.\\n\\t- Not sure, but probably justifiable\\n\\n6. A future involvement in Bosnia\\n\\t- Genocide - so called \\'Ethnic Cleansing\\'\\n\\t- Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.\\n\\t- Probably justifiable\\n\\n7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic,  \\nsomewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya  \\nor Israel.\\n\\t- My feelings in this are simple\\n\\t- Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent\\n\\t- I love the New Zealand government\\'s stand on banning all nuclear\\n\\t  armed or powered warships from NZ port.\\n\\t- Never justifiable.\\n\\nThese are my own views, I have looked at scripture, and I am confused. I  \\nwould appreciate others view, particularly those based on scripture.

O\\'Keefe\\n\\n\\nHARD BY THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT, within clear view of the Jefferson\\nMemorial, an easy stroll down the Mall to the majestic Lincoln Memorial,\\nhas arisen, on some of the most hallowed territory of the United States of\\nAmerica, a costly and dangerous mistake.  On ground where no monument yet\\nmarks countless sacrifices and unheralded achievements of Americans of all\\nraces and creeds in the building and defense of this nation, sits today a\\nmassive and costly edifice, devoted above all to a contentious and false\\nversion of the ordeal in Europe during World War II, of non-American\\nmembers of a minority, sectarian group.  Now, in the deceptive guise of\\ntolerance, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum begins a propaganda\\ncampaign, financed through the unwitting largess of the American taxpayer,\\nin the interests of Israel and its adherents in America.\\n\\n     How did the federal government allow the creation of such a\\nmonstrosity?  What is its meaning for American policy and for American\\nvalues?  And what must the American people do to regain control of the land\\ntheir servants in Washington handed over to a foreign interest and to\\nestablish an enterprise thereon, whether a museum or otherwise, informed by\\nand conducted according to American principles and interests?\\n\\n[Photograph captioned, \"The five-story, $150 million US Holocaust Memorial\\nMuseum in Washington, D.C. was built and is operated by a taxpayer-funded\\nfederal agency.  In the foreground is the museum\\'s six-sided \"Hall of\\nRemembrance.\"\\n\\n\\nORIGINS\\n\\n     In the late 1970s, during the presidency of James Earl \"Jimmy\" Carter,\\na propaganda campaign to promote the \"Holocaust,\" the alleged systematic\\nslaughter of some 6 million Jews by the Germans during World War II, was\\norganized and carried out from Hollywood and New York. As Benjamin Meed, an\\nimportant functionary of the council which controls the Holocaust museum,\\nwrote in 1990:\\n              \\n\\n          Almost a dozen years ago, a new phenomena [sic] developed.  The\\n     Holocaust was introduced into schools, colleges, and universities.\\n     Television broadcast programs on the Holocaust and millions of\\n     Americans watched them.  Soon, Americans took great interest in the\\n     lessons of the Holocaust, its uniqueness and its universal message.(1)\\n\\n\\n     Why the urgency of this campaign? Two factors were paramount:  first,\\nthe beginnings, more than three decades after the end of World War II, of\\nan objective scholarly assessment of the facts of the alleged German policy\\nto exterminate European Jewry.(2)\\n\\n     Second, the need to justify Zionist theory and practice in the face of\\nunprecedented international resistance to Israeli intransigence (including\\nthe famous UN General Assembly Resolution which equated Zionism with\\nracism), and to defend Israel\\'s aggressive policy under the leadership of\\nthe former terrorist, Prime Minister Menachem Begin.(3)\\n\\n\\nTHE U.S. HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL COUNCIL\\n\\n     In 1978 President Carter, his administration beleaguered at home and\\nabroad, succumbed to pressure from the new \"Holocaust\" lobby (and thus\\nAmerica\\'s influential Israel-first minority) by creating, through executive\\norder, the President\\'s Commission on the Holocaust.  Two years later, on\\nOctober 7, 1988, Congress passed--unanimously--a law establishing the\\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Council, charged principally with\\nconstructing and overseeing the operation of \"a permanent living memorial\\nto the victims of the holocaust\" and with providing \"for appropriate ways\\nfor the Nation to commemorate the Days of Remembrance, as an annual,\\nnational, civic commemoration of the Holocaust...\"(4)\\n\\n     A priceless tract of public land was turned over to the council, and,\\nafter years of costly delay (during which the U.S. Holocaust Memorial\\nCouncil\\'s budget swelled from $2.5 million to over $18 million a year), the\\nU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has been completed and readied for opening\\non April 22, 1993.\\n\\n\\nA SECTARIAN, ALIEN AGENDA\\n\\n     The Holocaust Memorial Council, besides soliciting tens of millions of\\ndollars in tax-deductible donations to finance the Holocaust museum, has\\nbusied itself with promoting an agenda of unalloyed support for minority,\\nZionist ends.\\n\\n     The membership of the council, a U.S. federal agency, has been\\noverwhelmingly Jewish since its founding in 1980.  The council\\'s two\\ndifferent chairmen--Elie Wiesel and Harvey Meyerhoff--have both been\\ncommitted to the support of the state of Israel, and the chairs of the\\ncouncil\\'s most important committees have been likewise Jewish and Zionist.\\n\\n     The chief fundraiser for the Holocaust museum, Miles Lerman, was\\nformerly American vice chairman for the State of Israel Bonds Organization,\\npromoting tax-free investment in a country which receives by far the\\nlargest amount of U.S. foreign aid per year.  Working the same wealthy\\nJewish Americans he has long dealt with in his fundraising for Israel,\\nLerman has helped raise nearly $160 million in tax-deductible\\ncontributions.  The biggest donors have been rewarded by having various\\ncomponents of the museum named for them, e.g. the Wexler Learning Center.\\n\\n     Nor is erecting and operating the Holocaust Memorial Museum the only\\nfunction with which the Holocaust Memorial Council has been charged.\\nAnother of its duties is to commemorate the Days of Remembrance for Victims\\nof the Holocaust, which Congress has raised to \"an annual, national, civic\\ncommemoration of the Holocaust.\"  Like the Israeli Yom Hashoah (Day of the\\nHolocaust), on which they are based, the Days of Remembrance are dated\\naccording to the lunar Hebrew calendar, and thus like Passover or Chanukah,\\nfluctuate from year to year. These foreign days of lamentation are\\ncurrently celebrated, under the flag of the republic, to prayers and chants\\nin Hebrew, in governmental settings from the Capital Rotunda to city halls,\\nacross the land.  Need it be stated that no group of American victims of\\npersecution, let alone another foreign group, enjoys any such federally\\nmandated and tax-supported day, or days, of recognition?\\n\\n\\nTHE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM\\'S ONE-SIDED \"HISTORY\"\\n\\n     Although the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council during its early years\\nmade noises about recognizing the ordeals of non-Jews during World War II,\\nby every indication from advance literature published by the council, the\\nU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is relentlessly Judeocentric.  While,\\naccording to a preliminary ground plan of the permanent exhibit, here and\\nthere are nods to non-Jewish groups oppressed by the German National\\nSocialists (never to groups victimized by Germany\\'s enemies, above all by\\nStalin\\'s USSR), the larger holocaust of World War II, which claimed an\\nestimated 75 to 80 million lives around the world, is ignored in preference\\nto the Jewish ordeal. Thus, to cite just one telling example, the museum\\'s\\n\"Life before the Holocaust\" exhibit refers strictly to *Jewish* life before\\nthe Holocaust.(5)\\n\\n     Where, in fact, non-Jews figure in the Museum, they figure largely as\\nvillains: the Germans and their allies and collaborators; the Western\\nAllies, including America, who refused to accept a large immigration before\\nthe war; the American political and military leaders who refused to\\nauthorize costly bombing raids on the Auschwitz \"gas chambers.\"\\n\\n        \\nRED LIBERATORS?\\n\\n     The museum\\'s message that support for Jews is the sole measure of\\ndecency during World War II leads to anomalies which, in an American museum\\nraised on ground hallowed to the principles of liberty on which this\\nrepublic is based, can only be called shocking.  That the victims of World\\nWar II atrocities by the Allies--massacres such as the fire-bombing of\\nTokyo and Dresden, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet\\nslaughter of their Polish prisoners at Katyn, the mass rapes carried out by\\nthe Red Army at the war\\'s end--receive no mention is deplorable.  But the\\nmuseum\\'s treatment of the armed forces which defended Stalin\\'s savage\\nSoviet tyranny is nothing short of grotesque.\\n\\n     In the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Communists appear only in the\\nguise of \"resistance fighters\" and \"liberators.\"  For example, the\\nsubmachine gun and false papers of Samuel Weissberg, a Communist Party\\nmember who rose to high rank in a Communist guerrilla group in North\\nFrance, are on honored display, no less precious a relic than the standard\\nheaps of shoes and hair, in the museum\\'s permanent exhibit.(6)\\n\\n     Even more unsettling is the honor given to Stalin\\'s notorious Red\\nArmy, which compiled a bloody and shameful record of atrocities across\\nEurope during, and after, the war.  As the U.S. Holocaust Memorial\\nCouncil\\'s newsletter fulsomely puts it, \"Flags will hang in the museum to\\nhonor the millions of Soviet soldiers who drove Nazi forces westward and\\nwho were the first Allied forces to liberate and publicize the existence of\\nthe camps.\"  In the words of Council chairman Harvey Meyerhoff, these\\nmartial banners of the Red tyranny have a single association: \"Much more\\nthan simply wartime memorabilia, these military artifacts are a significant\\ncontribution to memory, one that will remind future generations of the\\npivotal role Soviet forces played in defeating Nazism...\"(7)\\n\\n     What must the millions of Americans originating or descending from the\\nEuropean nations--Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,\\nPoland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, [former] Yugoslavia--\\nfor which the Red \"military artifacts\" symbolized invasion, tyranny,\\noppression and persecution of religion think as they see the fierce armies\\nof *their* persecutors hailed as \"liberators\"?\\n\\n\\nISRAEL IN THE MUSEUM\\n\\n     Just as one might guess from the circumstance that the museum\\'s\\ndirector, Yeshayahu Weinberg, and the head of its \"Learning Center,\"\\nYechiam Halevy, were brought in from Israel, the museum\\'s treatment of the\\nstate of Israel is adulatory.  An emotive tribute to the founding of Israel\\nis an integral part of the exhibition.  That the establishment of Israel,\\nand its expansion in subsequent wars, has meant colonial occupation and\\noppression for millions of the land\\'s native Palestinians, and\\ndispossession and exile for millions more, goes unmentioned--another\\ngrotesquery in an American museum supposed to instruct in the dangers of\\nintolerance and disregard of human rights.  As for the momentous\\ncollaboration between Hitler\\'s German state and the Jewish Agency in the\\n1930s, which through the Ha\\'avara Agreement enabled the transfer of vital\\ncapital and the influx of tens of thousands of highly skilled Jewish\\nimmigrants to Palestine, that is passed over in utter silence.(8)\\n\\n\\n\"HISTORICAL CORRECTNESS\"\\n\\n     The Holocaust Museum\\'s skewed history is not simply a matter of one-\\nsidedness and omission.  The museum has further committed itself to a fixed\\nand final interpretation of the surprisingly scanty and sometimes suspect\\nevidence for a German policy of annihilating European Jewry, largely in gas\\nchambers, in numbers approaching 6 million.  This despite a considerable\\nbody of research and scholarship that has arisen over the past two decades\\nin many lands, and which contests, by academic means, the substance of the\\nHolocaust \"extermination thesis.\"(9)\\n\\n     That the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council is aware of the work of the\\nrevisionists is clear: The council\\'s literature is replete, not with\\nsubstantive refutations of revisionist scholarship, but with slander and\\npolemic.  To cite one characteristic example, the _U.S. Holocaust Memorial\\nMuseum Newsletter_ of May, 1992 featured a front-page attack on Holocaust\\nrevisionism by Professor Deborah Lipstadt of Occidental College in which\\nthe author decried the revisionists for producing material that looked\\nscholarly, then lauded the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum as \"among the\\nmost efficacious ways\" of \"combating this pernicious trend,\" *while\\nneglecting to specify a single error of revisionist scholarship.*(10)\\n\\n     The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council recognizes that there is a\\nhistorical debate on the holocaust, but takes official notice of the\\ndissenting position only to attack it.  That an American institution,\\nsupported by the taxes of all Americans, should commit itself to inflexible\\nhistorical orthodoxy--in the service of a single American minority--is an\\nintolerable imposition on our First Amendment rights, as well as a mockery\\nof the Western, and American, ideal of objective scholarship.\\n\\n\\nA CENTER FOR EDUCATION?\\n\\n     U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council Chairman Harvey Meyerhoff has stated:\\n\"The museum is primarily an educational institution.\"(11)  From the\\ncouncil\\'s own literature, however, it is clear what Meyerhoff means by\\neducation.  The \"role-playing\" for children as well as adults who visit the\\nmuseum (visitors are to be issued \"identity cards\" bearing the name and\\nalleged fate of various Holocaust victims); the high-tech computer and\\nvideo effects and the recordings of speech and music which augment the\\nmuseum\\'s tendentiously described artifacts; and the museum\\'s goal, as\\nproclaimed by its Zionist fundraising chairman, Miles Lerman, of ensuring\\nthat \"Children in Dubuque, families in Tucson, and schoolteachers in\\nAtlanta will learn the history and the lessons of Auschwitz as thoroughly\\nas they learn the history of their own communities\"--all these show that\\nthe U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is a *propaganda* enterprise that seeks\\nto indoctrinate all Americans in a uniquely and partisanly Jewish (and\\nZionist) version of not merely the past, but the present and the\\nfuture.(12)\\n\\n\\nTHE AMERICAN RESPONSE\\n\\n     What is the American response to a partisan museum constructed in a\\nplace solemnly consecrated to the heroes and the values of our republic, to\\nbe lavishly operated with taxpayer dollars at a time when, even in our\\ncountry\\'s capital, thousands sleep homeless in the shadow of our national\\nmonuments?  What is the American response to an ambitious propaganda agenda\\nthat aims to impose a sectarian \"Holocaust remembrance\" in schools where\\nour children cannot pray, in town halls and federal buildings from which\\nthe religious symbols of the majority are banned in the name of freedom of\\nworship?\\n\\n     Over two centuries ago, Thomas Jefferson wrote: \"To compel a man to\\nfurnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he\\ndisbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.\"(13)\\n\\n     Nearly 150 years ago, Abraham Lincoln said: \"I insist that if there is\\n*anything* which it is the duty of the *whole people* to never entrust to\\nany hands but their own, that thing is the preservation and perpetuity of\\ntheir own liberties and institutions.\"(14)\\n\\n     The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the council which runs it, as\\nagencies of the government in which the American people is sovereign, must\\nbe removed from the special interest that now controls it.\\n\\n     The scope and purpose of the Museum must be expanded, from its present\\none-sided emphasis on foreign Jewish sufferings, real and imagined, in\\nEurope during the 1930s and 1940s to a compassionate yet realistic concern\\nfor *all* victims, but above all for *American* victims, of historic\\ninjustice.\\n\\n     The Museum must be made a place where Americans of every heritage, and\\nscholars of every viewpoint, may gather, educate, and be educated, without\\naccusation and in the absence of propaganda.  Until it is, the men and\\nwomen who founded and built and suffered and fought and died for America,\\nof every race, nationality and creed, will rest uneasy.\\n\\n\\nNOTES\\n\\n     1. _The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Newsletter_\\n(Washington, D.C.), August, 1990, \"Survivors Play Major Role in\\nEstablishing the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum,\" p.1.

Back\\nthen, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed.\\nAfter all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of \\nthousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and \\nmillions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and \\nother people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.

It is evident that the West, especially America,\\nmisjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and \\nthreatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world\\'s\\noil supply, he had to be stopped.

It would be a strong incentive, as Vesselin points out, for more\\npolice agencies to \"go rogue\" and try to get keys through more efficient\\n(but less Constitutional) means.  Notice what the release said:\\n\\n   Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n        a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n        encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n        decipher the message?\\n\\n   A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^\\n        court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.\\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe clear implication is that there are \"legal\" authorizations other\\nthan a court order.  Just how leaky are these?  (And who \\nknows what\\'s in those 7 pages that authorized the NSA?).  There\\nmay well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies, in which\\nkeys are traded.  Furthermore, the police will be in an excellent\\nposition to carry out this kind of thing without being caught.  They\\nalready have a communication infrastructure with secure portions.  There\\nare a few laws that I know of, that limit citizens\\' rights to access\\npolice communications (or use the information they get).  It may be\\nvery difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have such\\nevidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law.\\n\\nThrow in private detectives, who have even fewer policy/constitutional\\nrestrictions.  Also consider mercenaries who\\'ve \"retired\" from intelligence\\nagencies.  William Gibson must be loving it.  Great story material.\\n\\nDon\\'t think it\\'ll happen?  \\n\\nWell, consider e.g. the Michigan State Police, generally a very professional\\norganization, which for years kept \"Red Files\" on thousands of suspected \\ncommies, knowing full well it was not consititutional.  The standards\\nof evidence were just about zero: people were in the file because they\\nhappened to park near a place where, say, a US-China People\\'s Friendship\\nrally was happening -- the police went around writing down license\\nplate numbers.  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the \\nmeeting place, well, the state police wound up filing you as a subversive.\\n(They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on any\\nmore such nonsense.  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes\\nas well.)\\n\\nEven with well-meaning cops (and I\\'m sure there are many), there will \\nbe strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards.  We don\\'t need\\nto assume corrupt or unbalanced officers -- it will all be in the interest \\nof enforcing sensible laws, saving lives, and protecting property.  \\nCompromises will be made by well-meaning officers, facing what (to them) \\nwill be a moral dilemma.\\n\\nClipper will make criminals out of cops.

Treatment and\\nRehabilitation: A Practitioner\\'s Guide\".\\n\\nFirst, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn\\'t have your hands):\\n(note: you\\'re likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)\\n\\n  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries\\n  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI\\n  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI\\n  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI\\n  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)\\n  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.\\n  Pronation: Turning the palm down.\\n  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.\\n  Supination: Turning the palm up.\\n  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.\\n  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.\\n  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.\\n  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.\\n  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.\\n  Abduction: Moving away from the body.\\n  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.\\n\\nNow then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse\\nconditions.  Local problems are what you\\'d expect: specific muscles,\\ntendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.\\nDiffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle\\ndiscomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of\\ntenderness in muscles, although they\\'re not necessarily \"the problem.\"\\n\\n--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here\\'s the theory.\\n\\nNormally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which\\npass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict\\nthe blood flow.  By the time you\\'re exerting 50% of your full power,\\nyou\\'re completely restricting your blood flow.\\n\\nWithout fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,\\nthen they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates\\nnasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.\\n\\nOnce one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the\\nload.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes\\nthings worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,\\nand the cycle continues.\\n\\nAnother by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from\\nyour nerves.  They need blood too.\\n\\nAnyway, when you\\'re typing too much, you\\'re never really giving a change\\nfor the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never\\nrelax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor\\nergonomics, only make things worse.\\n\\n--- Specific injuries you may have heard of:\\n\\n(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute\\ninjuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have\\nless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)\\n\\nTenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis\\noccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to\\ncause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath\\'s ability\\nto lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets\\ninflamed, and you\\'ve got your problem.\\n\\nTendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon\\ncan cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,\\nand can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more\\nswelling, and more pain.  \"Sub-acute\" tendonitis is more common, which entails\\na dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse\\nwith repetitive activity.\\n\\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your\\nfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include\\nfeeling \"pins and needles\", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.\\nCTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.\\n\\nAdverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as \\'neural tension\\', this is where\\nthe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly\\ncompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.\\nAMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS \\ndisorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy \\n(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).\\n\\nOthers: for just about every part of your body, there\\'s a fancy name for\\na way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS\\nconditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors\\nmisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you\\nmay have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion\\nbefore somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).\\n\\n==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment\\n\\nThe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce\\ntension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.\\nIf you\\'re under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out\\nthe world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding\\nprinciple in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.\\nEVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every\\nthree minutes.  It\\'s also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,\\ncalm down, and relax.\\n\\nIf you can\\'t sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and\\nrelaxation are really a big deal.\\n\\nThere are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce\\ninflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad\\nposture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen\\nyour muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture\\nand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold\\ncontrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what\\'s best\\nfor you.\\n\\n--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was\\nwritten in the New Zealand book that I\\'m lifting it almost verbatim from\\nAppendix 10. -- dwallach]\\n\\n. Let your shoulders relax.\\n. Let your elbows swing free.\\n. Keep your wrists straight.\\n. Pull your chin in to look down - don\\'t flop your head forward.\\n. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.\\n. Try leaning back in the chair.\\n. Don\\'t slouch or slump forward.\\n. Alter your posture from time to time.\\n. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.\\n\\nSet the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There \\nshould be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,\\nand your thighs should not slope too much.\\n\\nNow, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable\\nto work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy\\nis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a\\nfootrest.\\n\\nNow, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space\\nbetween the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in\\nthe hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this\\narea.\\n\\nIf you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning\\nback, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.\\n\\n[Now, I diverge a little from the text]\\n\\nA good chair makes a big difference.  If you don\\'t like your chair, go\\nfind a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle,\\nback height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in\\nthe way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm\\nrests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good\\nstore and play with all these chairs -- pick one that\\'s right for you.\\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend \"Just Chairs.\"  The\\nname says it all.\\n\\n--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:\\n\\nThere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some\\npeople, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you\\nshouldn\\'t be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your\\nkeyboard to be \"right there\".  If you drop your arms at your side and then\\nlift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands\\nwhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid\\npronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads\\nmay or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and\\nlook at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It\\'s\\noften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or\\ndeviated hands.\\n\\nSome argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly\\ndesigned.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.\\nCheck out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.\\n\\n==5== Requests for more info\\n\\nClearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive\\nis incomplete.  There\\'s always more information out there.  If you\\'d like\\nto submit something, please send me mail, and I\\'ll gladly throw it in.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be\\nwonderful!  I\\'d love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  I\\'d\\nlove somebody to make a list of doctors.  I\\'d love somebody to edit the\\nabove sections, looking for places where I\\'ve obviously goofed.\\n\\n==6== References\\n\\nI completely rewrote the information section here, using a wonderful\\nguide produced in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & Health\\nService, a service of their Department of Labour.

For the same quality filter, higher oversampling\\nlets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher\\noversamplings lets you build better filters.

Sci., Urbana, IL\\nDate: Fri, 16 Apr 1993 21:01:10 GMT\\nLines: 107\\n\\n[An article from comp.org.eff.news, EFFector Online 5.06 - Carl]\\n\\n                       April 16, 1993\\n\\n      INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY  \\n                           PROPOSAL\\n\\n       The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement \\non cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of \\nmillions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a \\ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues \\nsuch as export controls which have effectively denied most people \\neasy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues \\nposed by new technology.\\n\\n       However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has \\nalready reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before \\nany public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the \\nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone \\nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed \\nby the National Security Agency. The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an \\n80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into \\nchips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow \\nagents would store users\\' keys, and be required to turn them over \\nlaw enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The \\nencryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be \\navailable to any manufacturer for incorporation into their \\ncommunications products.\\n\\n       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\\n\\n       First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution \\nbefore conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper chip may \\nnot be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may \\nhave better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the \\ngovernment as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather,\\nindependent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets \\nbased on open standards.\\n\\n       Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested. \\nYet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm \\nclassified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public \\nand open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a \\nstandard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.  \\n\\n       Third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed \\nsystem may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and \\nlaw enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored \\npublicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the \\nsafety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive \\nindividual\\'s fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal \\ninquiries?  \\n\\n       In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the \\nimportance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into \\ndigital privacy and security.  However, the \"Clipper chip\" solution \\nought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before \\nthe discussion even begins.\\n\\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\\n\\nESCROW\\n\\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of \\nwhom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid \\nwarrant, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts \\nover to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General \\nwill be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the \\nAdministration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal \\nagency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental \\norganization.  But, there is no agreement on the identity of the agents \\nyet.\\n\\nKey registration would be done by the manufacturer of the \\ncommunications device.  A key is tied to the device, not to the person \\nusing it.\\n\\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\\n\\nThe Administration claims that there are no back door means by \\nwhich the government or others could break the code without \\nsecuring keys from the escrow agents and that the President will \\nbe told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order \\nto prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for \\nan all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security \\narrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results \\nof the investigation would then be made public.\\n\\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\\n\\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government \\nbelieves in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big \\ncustomers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, \\nVP Al Gore, and maybe even the President. \\n\\nFROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\\n\\nJerry Berman, Executive Director\\nDaniel J.

We are talking about a time when\\nhonour and attitude, not measurable skills, were the most important assets\\na player brought to his team, his league and his sport.  This was before\\nthe onslaught of professionalism which has clearly denigrated what was \\nformerly the foremost peacetime pursuit of glory.\\n\\nThe Hart Trophy is not a prize.

Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,  \\nthe entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that  \\nthe machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather  \\navoid...\\n\\nSo my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  \\nwell with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about  \\n$90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how  \\ndo they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the  \\nextra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the  \\nISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so  \\nprobably all of this is just wishful thinking...

[emphasis mine]\".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention\\nthe two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.\\n\\nSo far as I can deduce, today\\'s consensus is built on at least three things: \\n1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the\\nlong passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory. \\nI don\\'t know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are\\norginally developed (does anyone?).\\n\\nBiblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The\\nformer, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and\\nideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I \\ndidn\\'t elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to\\nincorporate theology).\\n\\nCan\\'t say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before \\nGutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one \\nhand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any,\\nbecause anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is \\ncertainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have \\nthe two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic \\nms.

A cone shaped rotor is\\nhalf submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor\\nis powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed against\\nthe rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. \\nThe torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.\\n\\nBefore MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft\\nof torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was \\nadded to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of\\ntorque. \\n\\nHere is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, \\nyou still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.\\n\\nThey say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 oz\\nbottle is $25.\\n\\nI still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it was\\nso little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn't\\nbelieve it.  The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle against\\nmy common sense.\\n\\nHas anyone heard of or actually used this product? Is it real?\\nIf you are going to the auto show, please visit this stand on the \\nsecond floor. See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not.\\n\\nJason Chen\\n\\n\",\n",

The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin\\n\\n\\ne. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.\\n\\nYour perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.\\n\\nSimilarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.\\n--  \\n=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=\\n Eric Choi - Internet: Eric.Choi@p5.f175.n2240.z1.fidonet.org\\n',\n",

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\n   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\n   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n   (for better or for worse).\\n\\n   I pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\n   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\n   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\n   a portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\n   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\n   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\n   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\n   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\n   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\n   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\n   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n   \"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\n   frames.\\n\\n   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\n   for the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\n   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\n   That\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\n   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\n   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\n   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\n   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\n   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\n   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\n   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\n   action, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\n   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\n   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\n   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n   \"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\n   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\n   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\n   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\n   ease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\n   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\n   switching.\\n\\n   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\n   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\n   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\n   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\n   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\n   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\n   even more...\\n\\n   Lawrence D\\'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\\n   Computer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\\n   University of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\\n   Hamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47\\' 26\" S, 175^ 19\\' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\\n\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I missed the start of this thread, but there are three factors that\\ncan significantly affect QuickTime\\'s playback speed that you may want to take\\ninto account:\\n\\n(1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a\\nmovie back at the bit depth it was compressed for, this is usually 8 or 16\\nbit, but other depths are (of course) possible).\\n\\n(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for \"double size\" scaling, other scaling\\nfactors hit peformance much harder).\\n\\n(3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices\\nto advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I\\'m not sure about Premiere).\\n\\nAny combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size\\nis, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also\\nmake a real difference.\\n\\nForgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...\\n\\n-Peter Lee\\n\\n \\n--\\n/-------------------- Peter E.

But I can\\'t guarantee that I\\'m not way off base...\\n\\nThe permenant swap file is read/written to by windows by talking\\ndirectly to the hard disk controller card.  The controller card must\\nuse the protocal set up by western digital (or something like that).\\nWindows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory that\\npoints to that file.  It then uses the physical information about your\\ndisk to index to information in that file.\\n\\ncompressed disks are actually \"logical\" disks.  These disks have different\\ncharacteristics than the actual physical disk.  Furthermore, the information\\non the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used.  (i.e it must\\ngo through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating\\nsystem level or the BIOS level).  Because of this \"inbetween\" program, windows\\ncannot use direct methods to read from the \"logical\" disk.\\n\\na permenant swap file is only there to \"reserve\" an area of the disk that\\nwindows can use and to block that space from DOS.  Windows would theoretically\\nnot even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space. (I don\\'t\\nknow if it does or doesn\\'t...but it checks for it somewhere everytime you\\nboot windows.)\\n\\na temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windows\\nvia DOS and the BIOS.  If a disk compression program or other TSR is loaded\\nthe file access must go through DOS...TSR\\'S (disk compression)...and BIOS in\\norder to be access. (i.e. NEVER USE A TEMPORARY SWAP FILE...NEVER)\\n\\nmore on permenent swap files...\\n\\ni\\'m sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk\\nhas seen the message \"you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested\\nsize...windows will only use the size suggested...do you wan\\'t to create this\\nswap file anyway\" or something like that.\\n\\nwell, a friend of mine (ROBERT) called microsoft and asked them what and why.\\nwhat they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and\\ndivides that number by 2.  Then it checks for the largest contiguous block\\nof free disk space.  Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers.\\n\\nThey also said that under absolutely no circumstances...NONE!...will windows\\nuses a swap file larger than the suggested size.  Well...that\\'s what he \\nsaid!\\n\\nI call bull@#$#.

He stroked a line drive into the\\nright field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and\\nwent into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to\\nthe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he\\nmissed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,\\nreached up and caught the ball.  Home run.\\n\\nNow I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that\\nDarryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially\\nbehind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate\\nvicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with\\nStrawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan\\nwho caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious\\nto where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as\\nsoon as he realized he had made the catch.\\n\\nThat exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry\\nwent into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot\\nof profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of\\ncosting the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled\\nfood and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium\\nofficials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and\\njust relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,\\nLasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a\\ntirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about \\nwinning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made\\nthe catch.\\n\\nBefore each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech\\nwherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that\\nare hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any \\nthat are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have\\nbeen more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility\\nof interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he\\nis a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated\\nhis seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is\\nimpossible.\\n\\nOthers have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what\\nthe fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first\\nnine games.\\n\\nI question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull\\nhitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,\\nhe certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.\\n\\nBut I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities\\nof the fan.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\tThe Beastmaster\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\nMark Singer    \\nmss@netcom.com\\n\",\n",

I\\'ve put together a list and\\nindicated what I think each item is worth.  This is just my estimate, and I\\nam very open to any offers, including trades.  I\\'m currently looking for\\nsome CD-ROMs that will work with a Mac CD ROM player CD Caddies, HD floppy \\ndisks, any used Macintosh software, a 387-33Mhz Co-Processor, or basically \\nanything you have lying around (cans of soup, the neighbor\\'s cat, etc...)  \\nMake me an offer, no offer will be overlooked... \\nI really want to get rid of this stuff...\\n\\nOk, Here\\'s the list:\\n\\n52 Meg 3.5\" SCSI Hard Drive.  Conner Model #CP-3150.  I bought this from a guy\\n\\tat a swap meet to use with my Macintosh.  Unfortunately, I can\\'t seem \\n\\tto get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer.  The\\n\\tguy tested it with his PC, and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk \\n\\tDoctor report which says it has no bad sectors. (I\\'ll send you a copy) \\n\\tI was dumb enough not to get his phone number, so I can\\'t return it to \\n\\thim. The drive has many jumpers on it, (which I don\\'t know how to set) \\n\\tso maybe that\\'s the problem.  I was quite disappointed that it didn\\'t\\n\\twork so I\\'m trying to minimize my losses.\\t~$45\\n\\n52 Meg 3.5\" SCSI Hard Drive. Conner Model #CP-3150.  Same situation as above.\\n\\tI bought both of these drives from the same guy.  Despite the different\\n\\tmodel numbers they are the same exact drive.  Same report from NDD\\n\\t(I have one for each drive) will be included.\\t~$45\\n\\n40 Meg SONY 3.5\" SCSI Hard Drive.  SONY Model #SRD2040A.  The drive mechanism \\n\\tis completely trashed.  This hard drive was in my computer (Mac SE) and\\n\\thad a stiction problem.  Well, repeated banging on the side of the\\n\\tcomputer resulted in a head crash (yes, metal scraping metal) which\\n\\twas not too pleasant to listen to.  Still the SCSI controller\\n\\tcard is in good working order, and can be used for parts, or a \\n\\tproject.\\t~$20\\n\\n65 Meg Seagate 5.25\" HH SCSI Hard Drive.  Model #ST-277N.  I originally bought\\n\\tthis drive, because it had a small stiction problem, and I though that\\n\\tI could fix it.  Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine,\\n\\tand that it was a controller problem.  (motor controller wasn\\'t sending\\n\\tproper signals.)  Well, after taking the controller off the drive, \\n\\tlooking at it, and putting it back together, I realized that I\\n\\taccidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the \\n\\tdrive to the controller.  I tried to solder it, but I\\'m not that good\\n\\tat soldering so I couldn\\'t do it.  Worked perfectly before I messed\\n\\tup.  I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY (above) crashed on\\n\\tme.  Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications,\\n\\tworth well over $1000.  (Claris CAD, MS Word 5.0, Think C,\\n\\tExcel, and many others) \\n\\tI think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable.  You also get all\\n\\tthe software on the drive. (if you can accept being a pirate)  I only \\n\\task that you delete my data files from the drive.  I was really angry\\n\\twhen I broke that connection, and then couldn\\'t fix it.  I just don\\'t \\n\\thave time to play with it any more.\\t~$65\\n\\nAT&T ISDN 7500 Modem.  This is for use on digital phone systems.  If you know\\n\\twhat this is or would like technical information on it, let me know.  I\\n\\thave some tech documents on it.  Is supposed to be the same thing as an\\n\\tAT&T digital phone, but without the phone part.  It seems to be in  \\n\\tworking order (passes self test perfectly OK).  I have no idea how \\n\\tthis is worth...   Let me know if you\\'re interested.\\n\\nMotorola 68881 CoProcessor.  I haven\\'t tested this one out yet, but if anyone \\n\\tis interested I will get it tested out, to make sure that it works.  I\\n\\thad trouble using it with my accelerator board, but then I spoke to the\\n\\tmanufacturer of the board and found out it couldn\\'t be used without \\n\\tanother controller chip.  When I was looking around to buy one new, the\\n\\tprices were around $100.  I will guarantee this to work.\\t~$65\\n\\nCGA Card.  Half-Length. 8-bit.  Wasn\\'t working last time I checked (although\\n\\tI think I was using a bad monitor)\\t~$5\\n\\n5.25\"\\t360K Floppy Drive.  IBM Drive Type 1355.  Guaranteed to work, \\n\\tbecause when I took it out of the PC, it was working!\\t\\t~$25\\n\\n5.25\" 360K Floppy Drive.  Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE-A.  Guaranteed to \\n\\twork.  Came out of same PC as above.\\t~$25\\n\\n5.25\"\\tFloppy Drives.  Can\\'t guarantee that these will work.  I don\\'t\\n\\teven know if they are low or high density drives.  I don\\'t have\\n\\tany method of testing them.\\n\\t\\tPanasonic Model number: JU-455-5 ACG.  There\\'s another\\n\\t\\t\\tnumber on it: 2626-361723.\\n\\t\\tPanasonic Model number: JU-475-2 AGG.  There\\'s also\\n\\t\\t\\tanother number on it: H3649-101457\\n\\t\\tToshiba Model Number ND-08DE.  Virtually identical to the one \\n\\t\\t\\tabove.\\n\\tEach Drive ~$10\\n\\n3.5\" PS/2 Drive.  These things are proprietary, so I can\\'t test it, but I\\n\\tthink it works.  Not sure if it\\'s high density or low density, but I\\n\\tsuppose someone who is looking for one would know.  Model Number\\n\\tDFL413C04A.  I think these things are expensive to replace.  ~$35\\n\\nMFM Hard Drive Controller Cards.  I\\'ve got three of these, and I have no way\\n\\tof testing them.  Two of them are 8-bit cards, and one is a sixteen bit\\n\\tcard with a floppy controller built in.\\t~$10 for the 8-bits ~$15 for\\n\\tthe 16-bit card w/floppy.\\n\\nInteresting cable.

The dealer may also be liable; If the\\nprevious owner notified the dealer, or if the previous owner had the \\ndash replaced at a dealer, or if the previous owner had the dash changed \\nlegally, any records search on the car should turn up the fact that\\nthe odometer had been altered.

Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \\ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \\nJanuary 1994.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \\nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \\nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM DESIGN\\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \\ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\\n\\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\\nrelatively short time.\\n\\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \\nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \\nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \\nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\\n\\n\\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \\nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\\n\\n\\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\\n\\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\\n\\nSTEVEN BRENER\\t\\t\\t\\tSUSIE BROWN\\nJSTMP\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCarnegie Mellon University, GSIA\\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\\t\\tPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle\\t\\t\\tTelephone: (412) 268-7806\\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\\t\\t\\tFAX:\\t   (412) 268-8163\\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414\\t\\t\\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199\\t\\t\\n\\n############################################################################\\n############################################################################ \\n\\n\\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\\nmail.

The Clinton administration \\nnor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever \\nin regulating cryptography. To do so is tantamount to regulating \\n`acceptable\\' speech, and is blatantly unconstitutional. Perhaps we \\nshould rename this year `1984\\' in honor of such an illustrious \\nproposal.  Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy, and the adminstration\\nreceive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure.\\n\\nI am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology\\nto restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures.  The U.S.\\ngovernment will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any\\nserious threat to my liberties such as this, and I call on everyone\\nwith an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this \\nproposal.  The administration does not seem to understand that they\\nare merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the\\npublic, and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is \\nwholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty.\\n\\n>While encryption\\n>technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\n>unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\n>by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\nIt seems to me that U.S. Diplomatic communications should be \\ntappable by the U.N. whenever any countries produce a warrant to\\nthe U.N.  In fact, I think we should stop paying the NSA billions\\nof dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason.\\nThese actions violate the sovereignity of international law. (I hope\\nMr. Clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here.\\nBut if he isn\\'t, it\\'s a modest and reasonable proposal, so he should\\nfind merit with it nevertheless.)\\n\\nCryptography is neutral technology. If everybody has strong \\ncryptography (including policemen, bureacrats, businessmen, \\nhousewives, thugs and hoodlums), we have a sustainable \\nequilibrium.  Anything less is an unworkable anti-egaltarian \\narrangement, intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms, and\\nguaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent \\nimpracticality. We don\\'t need to compromise on issues of freedom.\\n\\n>For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our\\n>private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the\\n>tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of\\n>protecting Americans.\\n\\nFor too long our government has demonstrated itself to be \\nincreasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality \\nand protecting Americans.\\n\\n>Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\n>role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\n>quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\n>its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\n>protect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\n>them from those who break the law.\\n\\nIt is not possible for the Federal Government\\nto ``act quickly\\'\\' or develop ``consistent, comprehensive\\npolicies\\'\\' PERIOD.  And even if by some grandiose miracle such\\na thing were possible, it would only be an efficient way to\\ndeprive American citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights.\\n\\nThe administration has to be committed to leaving private \\nindustries alone, esp. on this issue.  The government has no \\nlegitimate role in regulating the content of communications.\\nLaw enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their\\nsurveillance bludgeon; they are soon and inevitably to be \\ndisarmed of it. \\n\\n>Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n>     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n>     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n>     powerful encryption devices?\\n\\nNo such laws can be constitutionally sound, and this is equivalent\\nto a veiled threat, which I don\\'t appreciate.  This kind of \\nextortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism. I will\\ntrade threats for threats, and violation for violation.\\n\\n>     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n>     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n>     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n>     effectively done);\\n\\nIf the administration did say this, it would find itself \\nimpeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential,\\nestablished, entrenched, and explicit constitutional privacy \\nguarantees. The administration would have no legal standing \\nwhatsoever; such an action would be egregiously illegal and\\ncriminal, and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast \\nsegments of the population.\\n\\n>     nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n>     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n>     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\" \\n\\nThe U.S., comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically \\ncommitted to preserving their privacy in the face of an \\nincreasingly totalitarian government, is saying just that.  \\nTake your chips and give them to NSA employees as Christmas bonuses.\\nWe can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please, \\nand we will make any chips we please, and we will send any bit \\npattern over our data highways we please.

We ran into one of my relatives at the \\nbus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away,\\nnear the store. Well at first we didn\\'t know what was happening, and then a\\nfellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, \"What are you\\nstanding here for? Go home immediately!\" I asked, \"What\\'s going on?\" He says, \\n\"What\\'s the matter, can\\'t you see, they\\'ve overturned a car and they\\'re \\nkilling Armenians!\" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.\\n\\nWe sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our \\ncourtyard. But the neighbors wouldn\\'t let them in the building. There were \\nabout 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They\\nwere shouting something, but you couldn\\'t understand it. It wasn\\'t one voice \\nor two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35.\\nThey went up to the third _floor, and we see that they\\'re breaking glass and \\nthrowing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one \\nhas a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a \\nguitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.\\n\\nWe had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School \\nNo. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families \\nthere with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only \\nknown Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani \\nguard at the school let us in. At first he didn\\'t want to, but there was \\nnowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We \\nwere told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our \\nmicrodistrict.\\n\\nWe went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.\\n\\nOn the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be\\nused to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of \\nthem and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I\\nasked him for assistance. I say, \"We\\'re in School No. 33, we need to be \\nevacuated.\" Well he says, \"Got it, wait there, I\\'m sending out help now.\"\\n\\nI know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with\\nhim personally. When I called he said, \"Muslimzade here.\"\\n\\nAbout two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out\\nthe window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, \"Armenians, come \\nout, we\\'re here to get you.\" They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in \\ntheir hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, \"Where should I go?\" I \\nsay, \"If your life is of any value to you you\\'ll go down there and say that \\nthe Armenians were here and that they left.\" That\\'s what he did. He went down \\nthere and said, \"The Armenians were here,\" he said, \"I let them out the back \\ndoor, they went that way.\" And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and \\nnoise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.\\n\\nSo the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right!\\nInstead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that\\nMuslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that \\nwe were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the \\nmorning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.\\n\\nIn the morning we went to my relative\\'s in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers \\ntook us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there \\nwere lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy, \\nabout three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn\\'t a single doctor, \\nnothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was\\njust very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything\\nthey could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his \\nmother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...\\n\\nI searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I\\nwanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third\\nfloor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping, \\nwith their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of \\nthem.\\n\\nThere were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten, \\neveryone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City\\nParty Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage \\nwas 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being\\nsold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to \\nget the things any cheaper.\\n\\nI met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in\\nhis eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we \\nworked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw \\nme and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his \\nfeelings, of course.\\n\\n   April 8, 1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Can he be impartial\\n     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or\\n     will he assume the superstition of his parents\\n     when questioning? \\n\\nI\\'ve often found it to be the case that the theist\\n     will stick to some kind of superstition when\\n     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I\\'ve\\n     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,\\n     and the other theists alike.  All assume that\\n     their mothers and fathers were right in the\\n     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief\\n     search for their god.\\n     \\nOccasionally, the theist may switch religions or\\n     aspects of the same religion, but overall the\\n     majority keep to the belief that some \"Creator\"\\n     was behind the universe\\'s existence.  I\\'ve\\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\\n     versa, I\\'ve known Christians who were once\\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I\\'ve even known\\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\\n     their transition from one faith to another,\\n     they\\'ve kept this belief in some form of higher\\n     \"being.\"  Why?\\n     \\nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\\n     the Torah, the Qur\\'an, & etc.  He is told\\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\\n     He is also told that to question this (as\\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\\n     ture\\'s truth is to damn one\\'s soul to Hell.\\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\\n     matter of course.\\n     \\nBut it doesn\\'t stop there.  Once the child is able\\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \\n     superstitions he\\'s been taught are nearly\\n     impossible to remove.\\n     \\nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\\n     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most\\n     theists can somewhat, especially when presented\\n     with \"mythical gods\" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,\\n     & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption\\n     of God\\'s existence and question it impartially?\\n     \\nStephen\\n\\n    _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\\n   _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\\n  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\\n       _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\\n_/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\n',\n",

I have attempted to gather as many case histories as\\npossible to find some estimate of success and risk. The number of replies\\nprobably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that\\nsuccess rates may be higher than the previous 80% estimate. 24 of 24\\nmachines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present.\\nThis is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with.\\n\\nThanks to all who contributed to this poll. \\n\\n\\nIssues:\\n\\n\\tSpeed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without\\n\\t\\tadd on cards. All reported machines were able to use\\n\\t\\t25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present. Several Apple\\n\\t\\tNubus cards were in use. No machine with the Nubus adapter\\n\\t\\twas able to go faster than 25 mhz. One wasn't even able to\\n\\t\\tachieve 25 mhz with the Nubus adapter in place\\n\\t\\n\\t\\tAt speeds of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distorted and\\n\\t\\thi density floppy disk problems have been reported.\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tNote: Unless specifically listed below, machines were not\\n\\t\\t\\ttested with a higher speed clock to failure. Hence,\\n\\t\\t\\tthe 25 mhz operational machines may well work at\\n\\t\\t\\thigher speeds.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\tDamage) One user reported pulling out the plating of one pad. This was\\n\\t\\trepaired and the machine is operational. One other\\n\\t\\treported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator\\n\\t\\tduring desoldering. There is one second hand report of a user\\n\\t\\tputting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron.\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tNo reports of static discharge damage.\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tNo reports of high speed operation causing damage.\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tThen again, I also don't have any reports from users of\\n\\t\\tdefective parachutes.\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tAdd on boards) Compatibility appears to be a problem with Apple Nubus\\n\\t\\tAdapters. Several other add on boards have been used with\\n\\t\\tsuccess. See case histories\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tHeat Sinks) Virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed.\\n\\t\\tThese were often the TO-220 style power transistor type. Some\\n\\t\\tused epoxy. Some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab\\n\\t\\tof cyanoacrylate glue. There was also use of a clamp with a\\n\\t\\tbolt through the hole in the motherboard.\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\nCase Histories:\\t\\n\\nAll speeds are the effective CPU speed (1/2 of clock oscillator).

I applied\\nto about 20 schools, got two interviews, got one offer, and am waiting to\\nhear from the other school.\\n\\nLet me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medical\\nschool admissions process.  Numbers (GPA, MCATs) are not everything, \\nbut they are probably more important than anything else.  In fact, some\\nschools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even look\\nat your other qualities.  Of course, when this happens, don't expect a refund\\non your $50 application fee.\\n\\nBut, the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbers\\nand are very well qualified academically.

How\\ndid your interviews go?\\n\\nAs for how long you have to wait, I've called a few schools who never contacted\\nme for anything.  Many of them told me that the interview season for them was\\nover and that if I haven't heard by now, I can assume a denial.  Many rejection\\nletters are not sent out until May or as late as June.  But some schools are\\nstill interviewing. I really don't think you should worry.  Don't become\\nfixated on the mailbox, go out, have fun, be very proud of yourself.\\n\\nWhat do people think of the medical school admissions process?  I had a very\\nmediocre GPA, but high MCAT scores, and I have been working as a software\\nengineer for two years.  I majored in Computer Science at Stanford.  Still,\\nI think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitted\\nis something like this:\\n\\nVERY IMPORTANT\\n--------------\\nGPA:\\t3.5 or better\\nMCAT:   top 15% in all subject\\n\\nMEDIUM IMPORTANCE\\n-----------------\\nWriting/Speaking ability\\nMaturity\\nMotivation for going into medicine\\nActivities\\n\\nLESS IMPORTANT\\n--------------\\nCollege or University\\nMajor\\nWork experience\\nAnything else you want them to know\\n\\n\\nAnyway, you are in good shape.  I think admissions committees are bound in\\nmany ways by the numbers, but would like very much to understand each\\nperson as an individual.  Sometimes thats just not practical.

(Might be a \\nuseful bargaining strategy even if you see no reason to go over 80M, though\\nI must admit that I am such a packrat that within 6 months of getting my \\ncomputer, I was backing up a lot of stuff to floppies that I rarely use to \\nbecause I was running out of space, without having started using DTP stuff, \\nsoftPC or trying any unix os!)\\n\\n-Peter\\nbell@minerva.cis.yale.edu \\n\",\n",

It had  \\ngiven us flawless service until last week.  The problem: Someone in our lab  \\nhas an old 512 that was upgraded a couple years ago to a Plus with an  \\naftermarket SIMM/SCSI setup (Digigraphics \"SIMMer\").  the DB25 SCSI plug runs  \\nthrough the back of the machine and attaches to the board with a 26-pin  \\nrectangular connector.  Well, this guy had removed the back from the machine,  \\nto put more memory in, and had disconnected the the SCSI plug.  Since the  \\n26-pin connector is symmetrical (not keyed) he may have reinstalled it upside  \\ndown, essentially reversing the pins on the DB25.  He came in and asked if he  \\ncould try out our HD on his SCSI port (it had never been used).  Naive fools  \\nthat we are, we said o.k..  His computer failed to recognize the drive.  Now,  \\nnone of the computers in our lab will recognize it.  We tried Disk Doctor, and  \\nit doesn\\'t recognize anything on the SCSI chain.  Could installing the SCSI  \\nupside down have wrecked the HD\\'s driver board?  The drive seems to spin up  \\nall right and unpark itself upon powerup.  The events are too coincidental to  \\nattribute the problem to stiction.\\n\\nAny help greatly appreciated-\\n\\nJames\\njak@fff.chem.utah.edu  (NeXT Mail)   \\n',\n",

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for\\n many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size\\n and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard\\n x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,\\n bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)\\n may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different\\n line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of\\n distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in\\n the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek\\n alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts\\n can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device\\n drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile\\n format and renderer.\\n\\n The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.\\n The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly\\n granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without\\n consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT\\n object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it\\n is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely\\n available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed\\n somewhere in the documentation for the package.\\n\\n We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of\\n user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any\\n published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,\\n which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that\\n as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the\\n kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest\\n in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only\\n afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on\\n those which help us get our work done.\\n\\n PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically\\n without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub\\n routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any\\n modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the\\n header file \"plplot.h\"; see the documentation for more details.\\n\\n The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of\\n several TeX files; please consult this for additional information (\\'latex\\n plotdoc\\').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to\\n the code, so don\\'t be surprised if some known features are not explained\\n there.  Consult \\'Changes.log\\' to see a list of recent changes.  \\n\\n At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:\\n\\n\\t Unix:\\tSunOS\\n\\t\\t A/IX \\n\\t\\t HP-UX\\n\\t\\t Unicos\\n\\t\\t DG/UX\\n\\t\\t Ultrix\\n\\t\\t SysV\\n\\t\\t Linux\\n\\n\\t Amiga/Exec\\n\\t MS-DOS\\n\\t OS/2\\n\\t NeXT\\n\\n For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:\\n  - appendices to the PLPLOT manual\\n  - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.\\n\\n To become a subscriber to the PLPLOT mailing list, send a request to\\n plplot-request@dino.ph.utexas.edu.\\n\\n CREDITS\\n -------\\n\\n PLPLOT is the result of the effort of many people, so it is impractical to\\n list all the contributors.

Should I, at this point break into caps and start talking about \\nDEFENSE etc.?  I don't know how 'fully engaged' Turkey is/was though.\\n\\nhenrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 \\nhenrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the \\nhenrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending \\nhenrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION. \\n\\nBM] Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them\\nBM]  within their borders?  \\n\\nhenrik] Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into \\nhenrik] the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.\\n\\nSo I hear.  This justifies bloodshed N years after the fact?\\n\\nhenrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the \\nhenrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER \\nhenrik] OCCUR again.\\n\\nBM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?\\n\\nhenrik] It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped\\nhenrik] into Armenia if SHE could.\\n\\nWhy would Turkey do that?  Do you not realize that this is a local clash\\nthat Turkey never wished to see happen?  Turkey has other plans for region,\\nlike economic revival, co-operation etc.  Good stuff in other words,  I'd\\nbe happy to bicker with Armenians over trade barriers and such on USENET\\nrather than 'who killed whom in what way' which I detest doing and wouldn't \\ndo.  \\n\\nBM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header\\nBM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  \\n\\nhenrik]\\t   Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many\\nhenrik]\\t   cases, HISTORY repeats itself. \\n\\nEven if one buys into your implicit premise, the sane thing to do would\\nbe to try not to provoke Turkey as was done in '74.  If there'd been\\na democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in Athens at the\\ntime, everybody would have stayed home with their families.  [I have no\\nwish to go into the Cyprus quarrel, but I suspect what I've said is not\\nonly accurate but also palatable to all parties involved]\\n\\nBM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes \\nBM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring\\nBM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians \\nBM] are attacking Azeri towns.\\n\\nhenrik]\\t   So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey\\nhenrik]\\t   wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!\\n\\nSo what do you think we want?  War, death and destruction?  \\n\\nhenrik]\\t   I will believe it when I see it.\\n\\nNo, if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it.\\n\\nhenrik]  Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing\\nhenrik]to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?\\n\\t\\nThis kind of childish rhetoric doesn't help anthing.\\n\\nhenrik]  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the\\nhenrik]  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean\\nhenrik]  BURNING people ALIVE !\\n\\nNow, some Azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff\\nperpetrated by Armenians.  One should re-hash stuff like this often to\\nkeep the hatred alive, right?\\n\\nBM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the \\nBM]futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that \\nBM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's \\nBM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.  \\n\\nhenrik]\\t   Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are \\nhenrik]\\t   NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY \\nhenrik]\\t   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN. \\n\\nWell they obviously aren't getting anywhere with their current methods\\nof asking (not very peaceful I'd say).\\n\\nBM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent \\nBM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe \\nBM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better \\nBM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?\\n\\nhenrik]\\t   Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the\\nhenrik]\\t   conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in\\nhenrik]\\t   KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.\\n\\nI don't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans.\\nPeace isn't what's happening right now, furthermore what's happening\\nright now isn't condusive to peace.  You can spend days and nights \\nraving about how 'right' the Armenian position is and I'm sure\\nthere'll be others who'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other\\nside.  If entrenched positions lead to war, and if people want peace\\nthan they should sit down and talk about a compromise.  Armenia isn't\\nstrong enough to exercise the 'we think we're right, and we have the \\nbombs, so we'll do whatever we want, so there...' style of foreign \\nrelations.  Yes you can type Stalin in caps, and give one sided\\natrocity stories etc. but for peace you need to be willing to talk to \\nthe other side.  You personally can choose not to do that of course,\\nthis being just USENET.  The people in power shouldn't be so childish.\\n\\n\\nBM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes\\nBM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of \\nBM] their blood and future. \\n\\nhenrik]\\t   Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension\\nhenrik]\\t   to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH\\nhenrik]\\t   are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.\\n\\nAzeri's would disagree with you on this, and the maps I've seen support\\nwhat they'd be saying.  It doesn't seem likely that a solution will be\\nreached in this manner.  \\n\\nBM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize \\nBM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians\\nBM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate \\nBM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in\\nBM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for\\nBM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading\\nBM] inflammatory half-truths.\\n\\nhenrik]   It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative.

It does no one any good to deny it.\\n>It only makes the more reasonable Muslims look like they are protecting the\\n>bad ones.  Can you see that?\\n\\nI don\\'t deny this fact.\\n\\nThe thrust of my argument here is that \\n\\n(a) Salameh is, according to US law, innocent as he has not been found\\nguilty in a court of law.  As his guilt has not been established, it is\\nwrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.\\n\\n(b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps\\nhave not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is\\n_not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and\\n_in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important \\ndistinction.\\n\\nI should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say \"Muslim\".  In\\ngeneral, anyone who calls themselves a \"Muslim\" and does not do or \\noutwardly profess\\nsomething in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam\\nis considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to\\nIslam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a\\nMuslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential\\nprinciples, though, then one does leave Islam.\\n\\nThe term \"Muslim\" is to be contrasted with \"Mu\\'min\", which means \"true\\nbeliever\".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu\\'min is\\nsomething known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you\\nwill not find the term Mu\\'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism,\\nbecause it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I,\\nfor example, am a \"true believer\" or not.  For example, I could just be\\nputting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to\\nwhat I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say \"Muslims\"\\nwe mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in\\npractice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By\\n\"Muslim\" we do not necessarily mean \"Mu\\'min\", or \"true believer\" in\\nIslam.\\n\\n Fred Rice\\n darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \\n\\n',\n",

After you read about\\nmy situation, I\\'d like your opinion.  Here\\'s the scenario:\\n\\n1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive).\\n    The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both \\n    systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup / \\n    restore program.  Both systems have 3.5\" and 5.25\" floppies.\\n\\n2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon).\\n\\nFrom what I have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possible\\nsolutions (I\\'m sure there are others I haven\\'t thought about).  For these \\noptions, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees \\nany flaws (drive type X won\\'t coexist with device Y, etc.) in my thinking \\n(I don\\'t know very much about these beasts):\\n\\n1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.\\n    Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What\\'s a good brand?\\n    What do the floppies themselves cost?\\n\\n\\n2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and\\n    continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again, can someone recommend a\\n    few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any\\n    happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)?\\n \\n\\n3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and\\n    (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?)\\n\\n\\n4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again, any gotcha\\'s or \\n    recommendations for manufacturers?  \\n\\nI appreciate your help.  You may either post or send me e-mail.  I will\\nsummarize all responses for the net.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nGeorge\\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\\n  George J.

There are\\nverifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments\\nabusing gun-control restrictions.  I don\\'t think it is paranoid\\nto worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused\\nin thye future.  After so many times of getting burned any sane person\\nwill stop putting his hand on the stove.\\n\\n>OR you should\\n>get a new goverment. (You do have elections??)\\n\\n       I\\'d love to.  But as long as the politicians grab power to sell\\npork back to their constituents, there\\'s not a lot I can do.  \\n\\n       It\\'s silly to suggest that if there\\'s anything we can\\'t trust\\nthe government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed\\nto do it, then we should change governments.  Down that road lies\\ntotal government power.   I\\'ve never been a fan of totalitarianism.\\n\\n>Guns \\'n Criminals:\\n>MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen.\\n\\n       This is very likely.\\n\\n>Known criminals can NOT buy weapons, that\\'s one of the points of gun control.\\n>And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia (and most of europe),\\n>we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns.\\n\\n       The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many\\npeople would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they\\'re\\nhere.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is\\nnecessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should\\nhave always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don\\'t.\\nUnless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more\\nmagical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more\\nheavily patrolled) then I really can\\'t accept that argument.\\n\\n>Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one:\\n>What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS!\\n\\n       No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S.,\\ntwo-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don\\'t have suicide\\nrates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about\\nhalf the per-car death rate.\\n\\n>The issue (I hope..):\\n>I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem.\\n>Guns are not a problem, but the way they are used is.... (and what are they for??)\\n>\\n>I think this discusion is interesting when you think of (ex)Jugoslavia:\\n>They should all have weapons, it\\'s their rigth to have them, and if they use them\\n>to kill other (Innocent) people the problem is humans, not guns.\\n\\n      The problem\\'s been humans since before we had stone axes.  The\\nfct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody,\\nwhether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally\\nirrelevent.\\n\\n      Yet weapons are *built*.  I\\'d suggest, then, that the murderous\\nimpulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.\\n\\n      Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt\\nto kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even\\nif we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.\\n\\n>If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them\\n>or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem,\\n>it\\'s the \\'axer\\' ??\\n>(An example, don\\'t flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)\\n\\n\\n       In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms.\\n(50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per \\nse, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe\\'s\\ncountries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don\\'t really think we\\'ve got\\nmore knives or fists.  \\n\\n       In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S.\\nhave been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms\\nof prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they\\nare doing, you won\\'t solve your problem.  And if the problem is \\nviolent crime, you shouldn\\'t concentrate on the tools instead.  The\\n*vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of\\n99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that\\nyou can\\'t make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.\\n\\n>Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect\\n>themselves. Is this a good situation ?? \\n\\n       The situation is not \"good\" in that people fear for their lives.\\nBut recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots,\\nprotecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they,\\ntoo, lost their livelihoods?\\n\\n>Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ??\\n\\n       The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn\\'t.\\nHowever, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can\\nbe appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition\\nwon\\'t make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.\\n\\n       You have to examine which problem you\\'re referring to.  If\\nyou\\'re discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is\\na perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully\\nsimply letting them know you\\'re prepared to shoot them would be enough,\\nas it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)\\n\\n>If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have\\n>guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA)\\n\\n       45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun.\\nThat accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans.\\nFirearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the\\ngroup *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.\\n\\n       You may take that for what it\\'s worth.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid Veal Univ. of Tenn.

DeYoung\\n\\nW. Petersen\\n\\n     More recently Wright\\'s understanding has itself been questioned from a\\ndifferent direction.  In a brief 1986 study William Petersen found linguistic\\nconfusion in using the English word \"homosexuals\" as the meaning of\\narsenokoitai.[22]   He faulted Wright and English Bible translaions for\\nrendering it by \"homosexuals\" in I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10.\\n\\n     In a sense Petersen has coalesced Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs into a\\nsingle assertion that reiterates, in effect, the position of Bailey.  He finds\\n\"homosexuals\" unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic.  \"A\\nmajor disjunction\" exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the\\nthought and terminolgy in Paul\\'s time (187-88).\\n\\n      What is this \"disjunction\"?  He bases it on historical and linguistic\\nfacts.  Accordingly, ancient Greek and Roman society treated male sexuality as\\npolyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts. \\nVirtually all forms of behavior, except transvestism, were acceptable. \\nChristianity simply added the categories of \"natural\" and \"unnatural\" in\\ndescribing these actions.  Ancient society know nothing of the categories of\\n\"homosexuals\" and \"heterosexuals,\" and assumed that, in the words of Dover\\nquoted approvingly by Petersen, \"everyone responds at different times to both\\nhomosexual and to heterosexual stimuli. . .\" (188). [23]\\n\\n      In contrast to this, modern usage virtually limits the term \"homosexual\"\\nto desire and propensity.  K.M. Benkert, who in 1869 coined the German term\\nequivalent to \"homosexual,\" used it as referring to orientation, impluse or\\naffectional preference and having \"nothing to do with sexual acts\" (189).\\n\\n     Petersen then proceeds to cite the \"Supplement to the Oxford English\\nDictionary,\"  which defines \"homosexual\" only as a propensity or desire with no\\nmention of acts.  Petersen\\'s point is that by using \"homosexuals\" for\\narsenokoitai, one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history\\n\"where no equivalent concept existed\" (189).  Consequently the translation is\\ninaccurate because it \"includes celibate homophiles,. . . . incorrectly exludes\\nheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts . . . [and]incorrectly includes\\nfemale homosexuals\" (19=89).  Prior to 1869 there was no \"cognitive structure,\\neither inour society or in antiquity, within which the modern bifurcation of\\nhumanity into \\'homosexuals\\' and \\'hetersosexuals\\' made sence\" (189).\\n\\n     The foregoing clarifies why Petersen feels that the translatio\\n\"homosexual\" is mistaken.  Yet is it possible that Petersen is the one\\nmistaken, on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds?  The next\\nphases of this paper will critically examine Petersen\\'s position.\\n\\n                        THE JUSTIFICATION FOR TRANSLATING\\n                          ARSENOKOITAI BY \"HOMOSEXUALS\"\\n\\nHistorical Grounds\\n\\n     A refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai\\nby \"homosexuals\" begins with the historical and cultural evidence.  Since\\nvirtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before Paul\\'s\\nusage, no historical settings earlier than his are available.  Yet much writing\\nreveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary\\nwith Paul.  The goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of\\nhomosexuality, particularly homosexual orientation, in a way similar to\\npresent-day concepts.  \\n\\n     Peterson, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs claim that the homosexual\\ncondition, desire, propensity, or inversion -whatever it is called- cannot be\\npart of the definition of the term.  They assert this either because the term\\nis limited to acts of particular kind (Boswell, active male prostitutes; \\nScroggs, pederasty) or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient\\ntimes (Bailey; Petersen).  The following discussion will show why neither of\\nthese positions is legitimate.  Attention will be devoted to the latter postion\\nfirst with the former one being addressed below under \"Linguistic Grounds.\"\\n\\n     In regard to the latter position, one may rightfully ask, did not the\\nhomosexual condition exist before 1869?  Is it only a modern phenomenon? Yet if\\nit is universal, as alleged today, it must have existed always including\\nancient times, even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it. \\nIndeed, evidence show that the ancients, pre-Christian and Christian, not only\\nknew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior, including all forms of\\nsame-sex activity (transvestism included), but also knoew about same-sex\\norientation or condition.  Petersen admits (190 n. 10) that Plato in\\n\"Symposium\" (189d-192d) may be a \"sole possible exception\" to ancient\\ningnorance of this condition.  He discounts this, however, believing that even\\nhere \"acts appear to be the deciding factor.\"  However, this is a very\\nsignificant exception, hardly worthy of being called \"an exception,\" because of\\nthe following additional evidence for a homosexual condition.\\n\\n     THe \"Symposium\" of Plato gives some of the strongest evidence for\\nknowledge about the homosexual condition. [24]   Plato posits a third sex\\ncomprised of a maile-female (androgynon (\"man-woman\"). Hence \"original nature\"\\npalai physis, consisted of three kinds of human beings.  Zeus sliced these\\nhuman beings in half, to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the\\ngods.  Consequently each person seeks his or her other half, either one of the\\nopposite sex or one of the same sex.  Plato then quotes Aristophances:\\n\\n    Each of us, then, is but a tally of a man, since every one shows like\\n    a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two;  and each is ever\\n    searching for the tally that will fit him.  All the men who are sections\\n    of that composite sex that at first was called man-woman are \\n    woman-courters;  our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex,\\n    whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses.\\n    All the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men:\\n    they are incllined rather to women, and of this stock are the she-minions.\\n    Men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine, and so long as \\n    their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by\\n    making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be\\n    clasped in men\\'s embrasces;  these are the finest boys and striplings,\\n    for they have the most manly nature.  Some say they are shameless\\n    creatures, but falsely:  for their behavior is due not to shamelessness\\n    but to daring, manliness, and virility, since they are quick to welcome\\n    their like.  Sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity\\n    these alone prove in a public career to be men.  So when they come\\n    to man\\'s estate they are boy-lovers, and have no natural interest in\\n    wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of\\n    custom;  they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days.\\n    A man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the \\n    willing mate of a man, eagerly greeting his own kind.  Well, when\\n    one of them -whether he be a boy-lover or a lover of any other sort- \\n    happens on his own particular half, the two of them are wondrously \\n    thrilled with affection and intimacy and love, and are hardly to be \\n    induced to leave each other\\'s side for a single moment.  These are\\n    they who continue together throughout life, though they could not\\n    even say what they would have of one another (191d-192c) [25]\\n\\nShould these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as\\nlong as they live, or even in Hades, Aristophanes says that each \"would\\nunreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all\\nthe time:  (192e).\\n\\n     Several observations about this text are in order.  Lesbianism is\\ncontemplated, as will as male homosexuality (191e).  \"Natural interest\" (ton\\nnoun physei), (192b) refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination. \\nThe words, \"born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man: \\n(paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai), (192b) reflect the modern claims \"to\\nbe born this,\" i.e., as homosexual.  The idea of mutuallity (\"the two of them\\nare wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love,\" 192b) is\\npresent.  Aristophanes even speaks of \"mutual love ingrained in mankind\\nreassembling our early estate\" (ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai\\ntes archaias physeos synagogeus, 191d). The concept of permanency (\"These are\\nthey who continue together throughout life,\" 102c) is also present.  Further\\nmention of and/or allusion to permanecy, mutality, \"gay pride,\" pederasty,\\nhomophobia, motive, desire, passion, and the nature of love and its works is\\nrecognizable.\\n\\n    Clearly the ancients thought of love (homosexual or other) apart from\\nactions.  THe speakers in the Symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is\\ncrucial;  money, office, influence, etc. . . bring reproach (182e-183a, 184b). \\nThey mention the need to love the soul not the body (183e).  There are tow\\nkinds of love in the body (186b) and each has its \"desire\" and \"passion\"\\n(186b-d).  The speakers discuss the principles or \"matters\" of love (187c), the\\ndesires of love (192c) and being \"males by nature\" (193c).  Noteworthy is the\\nspeech of Socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is\\nrelated to love and its objects (200a-201c).  Desire is felt for \"what is not\\nprovided or present; for something they have not or are not or lack.\"  This is\\nthe object of desire and love.  Socrates clearly distinguishes between \"what\\nsort of being is love\" and the \"works\" of love (201e).  This ancient\\nphilosopher could think of both realms -seaual acts as well as disposition of\\nbeing or nature.  His wors have significance for more than pederasty. [26]\\n\\n     In summary, virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and\\nhomosexuality is anticipated in the Symposium of Plato.  Petersen is in error\\nwhen he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts, not\\ninclination or orientation.  Widespread evidence to the contray supports the\\nlatter. [27]\\n\\n     Biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where\\nhomosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction.  In\\nRom 1:21-28 such phrases as \"reasoning,\" \"heart,\" \"becoming foolish,\" \"desires\\nof the heart.\" and \"reprobate mind\" prove Paul\\'s concern for disposition and\\ninclination along with the \"doing\" or \"working\" of evil (also see vv. 29-32). \\nEven the catologues of vices are introdiced (I Tim 1:8-10) or concluded (I Cor\\n6:9-11) by words describing what people \"are\" or \"were,\" not what they \"do.\" \\nHabits betray what people are within, as also the Lord Jesus taught (cf. Matt.\\n23:28).  The inner condition is as important as the outer act; one gives rise\\nto the other (cf. Mt 5:27).\\n\\n     Petersen errs regarding other particulars too.  Transvestism apparently\\nwas accepted by the ancients.   It was practiced among Canaaniteds, Syrian,\\npeople of Asia Minor, as well as Greeks, according to S.R. Driver. [28]  Only a\\nfew moralist and Jewish writers are on record as condemning it.  For example,\\nSeneca (Moral Epistles 47.7-8) condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an\\nadult slave to dress, be beardless, and behave as a woman.  Philo also goes to\\nsome length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women\\n(The Special Laws III, 37-41;  see also his On the Virtues, 20-21, where he\\njustifies prohibition of cross-dressing).  Even the OT forbade the interchange\\nof clothing between the sexes  (Deut 22:5).\\n\\n     Petersen is also wrong in attributing to Christianity the creating of the\\n\"new labels\" of \"natural\" and \"unnatural\" for sexual behavior.  These did not\\nbegin with Paul (Rom 1:26-27) but go as far back as ancient Greece and even\\nnon-Christian contemporaries used them.  Plato, the TEST.NAPH., Philo, Josephu,\\nPlutarch, and others used these words or related concepts. [29]\\n\\nLinguistic Grounds\\n\\nfootnotes\\n___________________________\\n22  W.L.

Dover, Greek Homosexuality (Cambridge, Harvard Univ, 1978) 1 n. 1.\\n24    We are conscious of the fact that Plato\\'s writings may not reflect\\nAthenian society, or that the speakers in \"Symposium\" may not reflect Plato\\'s\\nview.  However, it is assumed that they do, and with this agrees Dover\\n(Homosexuality 12) and other evidence cited below \\n25 The translation is that of W.R.M. Lamb, Plato:  Symposioum LCL (Cambridge:\\nHarvard Univ, 1967) 141-143.  Note the reference to \"adulteress.\"  If there is\\na homosexual condition derived from birth or the genes, logically there must\\nalso be an adulterous conditon derived from birth.\\n26 Elsewhere in the Symposium we are told that it is the heavenly love to love\\nthe male and young men (181c) but this must not be love for boys too young; \\nthe latter should be outlawed (181d-e).  Such love of youths is to be permanent\\n(181d), lifelong and abiding (184a).  Where homosexual love is considered a\\ndisgrace, such an attitude is due to encroachments of the rulers and to the\\ncowardice of the ruled (182d -an early charge of \"homophobia\"?).  In Athens it\\nwas \"more honorable to love openly than in secret\" (182d -an ancient expression\\nof \"coming out of the closet\").  Mutality was present (\"this compels lover and\\nbeloved alike to feel a zealous concern for their own virtue,\" 184b).\\n    For Petersen to label the Symposium a \"possible\" exception to his position\\nis inadequate and misrepresentative.  It is a significant witness to Greek\\nsociety hundreds of years before the time of Christ.\\n27 Dover (Homosexuality 12, 60-68) finds homosexual desire and orientation in\\nPlato\\'s works (Symposioum and Phaedrus) and elsewhere.  Philo writes of those\\nwho \"habituate themselves\" to the practive of homosexual acts (The Special Laws\\n3.37-42; cf. De Vita Contemplativa 59-63).  Josephus says that homosexuality\\nhad become a fixed habit for some (Against Apion 2.273-75)  Clement of\\nAlexandria on Matt. 19:12 writes the \"some men, from birth, fhave a natural\\naversion to a woman; and indeed those who are naturally so consitited do well\\nnot to marry\" (Miscellanies 3:1)  It is addressed in Novella 141 of Justinian\\'s\\nCodex of laws (it referes to those \"who have been consumed by this disease\" as\\nin need of renouncing \"there plague,\" as well as acts).  Pseudo Lucian (Erostes\\n48) and Achilles Tatius (Leucippe and Clitophon II.38) speak of it.  Finally\\nThucydides 2.45.2 has: \"Great is you glory if you fall not below the standard\\nwhich nature has set for your sex.\"\\n     Boswell (Christianity 81-87) cites poets (Juvenal, Ovid), witers\\n(Martial), statesmen (Cicero), and others who describe permanent, mutual\\nhomosexual relationships, even marriages.  Even emperors could be either\\ngay-married (Nero) or exlusively gay (Hadrian), Boswell says.  Scroggs\\n(Homosexuality 28, 32-34) admits that both inversion and perversion must have\\nexisted in the past.  He discusses possible references to adult mutual\\nhomosexual and lesbian relationships, but dismisses them (130-44).\\n28  See specifics in S.R. Driver A critical and Exegetical Commentary on\\nDeuteronomy (Edinburgh:1895) 250.  He observes that the prohibition of\\ncross-dressing in Deut. 22:5 is not a \"mere rule of conventional propriety.\" \\nSee also Dover, Homosexuality  73-76, 144.\\n29  Plato in his last work, in which he seeks to show how to have a virtuous\\ncitizen, condemned pederasty and marriage between men as \"against nature\" (para\\nphosin)(Laws 636a-b;  636c;  836a-c; 838; 841d-e).  According to TEST.NAPH\\n3:4-5 the sodomites changed the \"order of nature.\"  THe Jewish writers, Philo\\n(On Abraham 135-137) and Josephus (Ant. 1.322; 3.261, 275; Ag. Ap. 2.199;\\n2.273, 275) label sexual deviation as \"against nature.\"  Finally,, first\\ncentury moralist such as Plutarch (Dianlogue on Love 751c-e; 752b-c) spoke of\\nhomosexuality as \"against nature.\"  Christians clearly did not invent the\\nlabels \"natural\" and \"unnatural\".

Security Council Resolution 713 of \\n  September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively \\n  addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security \\n  Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all \\n  unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There \\n  have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages \\n  in Bosnia have been bombed.\\n  \\n  In response to these violations, the Security Council decided, \\n  in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all \\n  unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize \\n  Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-\\n  zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.  \\n  NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air \\n  enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General \\n  was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY \\n  FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating \\n  allies.\\n  \\n  The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my \\n  direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to \\n  all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct \\n  of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by \\n  the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces \\n  initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and \\n  12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.  \\n  These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. \\n  e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for \\n  combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.\\n  \\n  NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air \\n  patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early \\n  Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally \\n  operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the \\n  Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching \\n  the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted, \\n  escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these \\n  steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such \\n  aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by \\n  NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved \\n  \\n                                more\\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\t     \\t       \\t    (OVER)\\n\\x0c\\n                                  2\\n  \\n  rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will \\n  be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations \\n  Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was \\n  consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully \\n  considered before the rules of engagement were approved.\\n  \\n  It is not possible to predict at this time how long such \\n  operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces \\n  to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional \\n  authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-\\n  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and \\n  I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward \\n  toward attainment of our goals in this region.\\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\tSincerely,\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\tWILLIAM J.

My problem is that everyone I know already has one.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n        \\'nuff said.\\n\\n        The reason I\\'m not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a\\nunit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don\\'t have any\\noptical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has\\nsome other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn\\'t.  (I am also paying more\\nfor the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are\\navailable if you absolutely must have one.\\n\\n        Of course, it has SCMS.

See the sci.skeptic FAQ (I edit it).\\n\\nYou can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is the\\nClassic Example, but there are probably others.\\n\\nIridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  By\\nlooking at the patterns, striations and occasional blobs in the irises\\nyou are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body.\\n\\nThe two questions to ask any alternative therapist are:\\n\\n1: How does it work?\\n\\n2: What evidence is there?\\n\\nThe answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to\\nevaluate.  I don\\'t know about iridology, but I\\'ve read a book on\\nreflexology, which is a remarkably similar notion except that the\\norgans of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There are\\nsupposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or\\nenergy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures.\\n(Always beware the words \"channel\" and \"energy\" in any spiel put out\\nby an alternative practitioner.)\\n\\nThe answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have is\\nanecdotal evidence then forget it.  Ask for referreed papers in\\nmainstream medical journals.  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy of\\nrich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners.  Studies are done\\nand papers are published.  Some of them are even positive.\\n\\nThe word \"licensed\" in the flyer is an interesting one.  Licensed by\\nwhom?  For what?  It is quite possible that the herbology is real and\\nrequires a license: you can kill someone by giving them the wrong\\nplants to eat, and many plants contain very powerful drugs (Foxglove\\nand Willow spring to mind).  It is not clear whether the license\\nextends to the iridology, and I suspect that if you ask you will be\\ntold that it means \"(Licensed herbologist) and iridologist\".\\n\\nBTW, the usual term is \"herbalist\".

And key size is one of the things that can be\\n   verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the\\n   chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the\\n   output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output\\n   bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.\\n\\n   If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that\\n   some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that\\n   they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,\\n   DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output\\n   change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think\\n   NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.\\n\\nConsider a cryptosytem that starts out by XORing bits 23 and 47, and\\nnot using either of these bits except through this XOR. This system\\nmakes early use of every bit. but an exhaustive key search would now\\nonly have 2^79 keys to search. Your test by varying single key bits\\nwouldn't turn up anything interesting.\\n\\n   Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see\\n   the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased\\n   subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.\\n\\nThe algorithm I suggest above would stick out like a sore thumb, but\\nI'm sure I could design a system with a more subtle key redundancy\\nwhich was well-hidden, but would still make an exhaustive key search\\ntake far less than 2^80 encryptions. I don't believe your claim that\\nthe real keysize can be verified externally.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAndy Latto\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tandyl@harlequin.com\\n\",\n",

In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my\\nhome) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to\\ndrive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn\\'t just the epitome of\\na good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do\\nall the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.\\n\\nMy question:\\nWhat is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I\\nrealize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn\\'t going to\\nbe as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a\\nthing).  And I uderstand that I probably can\\'t expect much in the way of\\naccuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything\\'s gotta be better than\\ntrying to drive with a hosed ankle.\\n\\nI have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with\\nkettering(sp?) ignition (y\\'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not\\nelectronic.  Maybe you could\\'ve guessed it being an \\'84, but I\\'m just trying\\nto give information as completly as I can).\\n\\nI found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system \\ninstead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy\\nthis CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?\\n\\nIt has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the \\nnegative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I\\nunderstand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read\\nit in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but\\nharder to install.  Is there really a big difference?\\n\\nIt has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a\\nsensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn\\'t paying real close attention I\\nmight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which\\nwould wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned \\nthe thing off.  I\\'m pretty coordinated, so this doesn\\'t bother me, if it\\nwere for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I\\'m ok with it.\\n\\nThe installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal\\nand a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal\\nfrom the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I\\'m\\nnot sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what\\nexactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get\\nit?\\n\\nI think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative\\nside tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and\\nall that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:\\n\\n\\t1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a\\n\\t    device?\\n\\t2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?\\n\\t3.  Are \"professionally\" installed CCs signifacantly better and\\n\\t    worth the cabbage?\\n\\t4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just\\n\\t    that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple \\n\\t    needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,\\n\\t    the questions above)?\\n\\nMy father and I built a \"Veep\" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in\\nhigh school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and\\ncars.  So the installation doesn\\'t scare me.  I just want to be certain that\\nI get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more\\ncomplicated than my Veep. :-)\\n\\nI appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any\\nexpertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  If you would like to share\\nsome of your wisdom, please email as I don\\'t get over this group very often\\n(but I check my mail all the time).\\n\\nAgain, thanks for any help anyone may have.\\n\\nMike Wieda\\nMikew@canc.byu.edu\\n\\n',\n",

Very good\\nplayers who can lead lesser teams (Francis-Hartford, Tocchet-Philly) who\\nprovide the depth to the team that is currently best in the NHL.\\n\\nAs a defensive forward, there have been none better than Bob Gainey.  That\\ndoesn't mean he was the best player (or even the best forward) the Canadians\\nhad at that time, but he was excellent at what he did.  Gainey could\\ndominate games with his defence.  He didn't need to get goals to dominate.\\nHe shut down the opposition and was thus valuable.  There has never been\\nanyone any better at doing this.  Not ever.\\n\\nGregmeister\\n\",\n",

My range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons...\\nthat\\'s 50 mpg!!  Surprisingly, the bike is a real cruiser.  I was expecting\\nsomething rough.   She\\'s a sweet backroad honey.  And I can go pretty much\\nanyplace I\\'d take my mountain bike.  As far as shaft effect, it\\'s more a \\ntorque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion.  Rev it sitting still\\n(when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit.  Maybe\\nI don\\'t ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect, but in my opinion\\na little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence.  Okay, here are \\nmy questions:\\n\\n1) Any recommendations for a home-made fairing?  I\\'d like to keep the\\nwind off my chest, and perhaps my helmet, for comfort at highway speeds\\n(70 mph), yet don\\'t want to (a) screw up the stability or (b) block my\\nvision too much for trail riding.  Anybody have luck with two-piece \\ndetachible fairings?  I\\'d like to make it myself out of plexiglas.\\n\\n2) I run two lights, the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the\\ncrash bar.  The illumination\\'s excellent that way, with a full beam coming\\nout from the level of the motor (left side); the lamp beam is linear so\\nthat you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right, and it \\nreally picks up the periphery (deer lurking, etc.)  Combined with the \\nheadlamp on high you can see like day.  But I\\'ve heard that BMW alternators\\ndon\\'t crank out too much.  Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I\\'m\\nputtering around in the dirt at low RPM?  \\n\\n3) This is embarassing: I\\'m having trouble starting the bike first thing\\nin the morning.  I invariably flood the carbs, then go in and read a section\\nof the paper, and then she starts right up.  Is this a Zen thing? \\n\\n4) The Hayne\\'s manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline\\nwith alcohol additives... Yeah, right.  What do you folks due to keep\\nthe engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol?  Any \\nparticular brands of gas that are best?  Additives?\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\n/-----b-o-d-y---i-s---t-h-e---b-i-k-e----------------------------\\\\\\n|                                                                |\\n|     DoD# 88888           asphaug@hindmost.lpl.arizona.edu      |\\n| \\'90 Kawi 550 Zephyr               (Erik Asphaug)               |\\n|  \\'86 BMW R80GS                                                 |\\n\\\\-----------------------s-o-u-l---i-s---t-h-e---r-i-d-e-r--------/\\n',\n",

I\\'ve weathered attempted dog attacks before using the\\napproved method: Slow down to screw up dog\\'s triangulation of target,\\nthen take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it\\ndidn\\'t work because I didn\\'t have time. Riding up the hill leading to my\\nhouse, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to\\nthe Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to\\nthe Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to\\nharm.\\n\\nBut I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the\\nroughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph\\nfor the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the\\nleft side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he\\nhad been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,\\nheading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I\\nsaw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took\\nthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was\\ndriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent\\nmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think\\nI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this\\nmoment is hazy.\\n\\nI next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The\\napologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut\\nmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my\\nshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.\\nSo I\\'m left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!\\n\\nInterestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never\\nmoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike\\noff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some\\ngut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me\\nhere, as I didn\\'t feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.\\n\\nWhat worries me about the accident is this: I don\\'t think I could have\\nprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not\\nnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was\\nriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if\\nit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the\\nthought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a\\nblind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are\\nlong enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?\\n\\nI eagerly await comment.\\n\\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\\nDoD# 0863      |I\\'d be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\\n\\n\\n * SLMR 2.1a * \"He\\'s hurt.\" \"Dammit Jim, I\\'m a Doctor -- oh, right.\"\\n                                                                                       \\n----\\n+===============================================================+\\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\\n+===============================================================+\\n',\n",

Some of the land was in fact given to the  \\nJews by the United Nations, quite a bit of it was purchased from Arab  \\nabsentee landlords. Present claims are based on prior ownership (purchase  \\nfrom aforementioned absentee landlords) award by the United Nations in the  \\npartition of the Palestine mandate territory, and as the result of  \\ndefensive wars fought against the Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians, et al.\\n\\n***\\n> 2)Why do most of them speak of the west bank as theirs while most of\\n> the inhabitants are not Jews and do not want to be part of Israel?\\nFirst, I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the  \\nidea that the West Bank is theirs. Since,  however, I agree with those who  \\nclaim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West  \\nbank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion  \\nto attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis  \\npromptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining  \\npossession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats  \\nnational suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it  \\nis that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them  \\nand the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs  \\ncontinues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they  \\ncan launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West  \\nBank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is  \\nthe small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West  \\nBank.

Even when one starts with something one does\\n#not believe, one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says.\\n# \\n#To give you the benefit of the doubt, prove your statement.\\n\\nThe onus of proof is on you, sunshine.  What makes you think that\\ntheist leaders believe what they say?  Especially when they say\\none thing and do another, or say one thing closely followed by its\\nopposite?  The practice is not restricted to theism, but it\\'s there\\nfor anyone to see.  It\\'s almost an epidemic in this country.\\n\\nJust for instance, if it is harder for a camel to pass thru\\' the eye\\nof a needle, why is the Catholic church such a wealthy land-owner?  Why\\nare there churches to the square inch in my country?\\n# \\n#>#>Now, *some*\\n#>#>brands of theism, and more precisely *some* theists, do tend to fanaticism,\\n#>#>I grant you.  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry, not a reasoned\\n#>#>argument - and it reads to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction\\n#>#>of religious freedom.  Ever read Animal Farm?\\n#>#>\\n#>#That\\'s a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to\\n#>#repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to\\n#>#fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is,\\n#>#there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.\\n#>\\n#>No, some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common\\n#>with *some* fanaticism.    Your last statement simply isn\\'t implied by\\n#>what you say before, because you\\'re trying to sneak in \"innate features\\n#>of [all] theism\".  The word you\\'re groping for is \"some\".\\n#>\\n# \\n#Bogus again. Not all theism as is is fanatic. However, the rest already\\n#gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and\\n#theism. And further, the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them\\n#to switch to fanatism easily. It takes just a nifty improvement in the\\n#theology.\\n\\nTruth by blatant assertion.  \\n# \\n# \\n#>#Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.\\n#>\\n#>No shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism,\\n#>since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed\\n#>to the case you are trying to make?\\n#>\\n# \\n#Because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people\\n#causing the correlation. And the whole discussion started that way by the\\n#statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism, which you\\n#challenged.\\n\\nIndeed I did.  As I recall, I asked for evidence.  What is the correlation\\nof which you speak?  \\n# \\n# \\n#>#And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw\\n#>#men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.\\n#>\\n#>I said it reads like a warm up to that.  That\\'s because it\\'s an irrational\\n#>and bogus tirade, and has no other use than creating a nice Them/Us\\n#>split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either\\n#>side of church walls.\\n#>\\n# \\n#Blah blah blah. I am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights\\n#protects me better from fanatics than the other way round.\\n\\nOf course, other people are always fanatics, never oneself.  Your\\nwish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me.\\n# \\n#It is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between\\n#that argument and the rise of fanatism. So far, it is just another of your\\n#assertions.\\n\\nSo?  You can do it.\\n# \\n# \\n#>#>|>(2)  Define \"irrational belief\".  e.g., is it rational to believe that\\n#>#>|>     reason is always useful?\\n#>#>|>\\n#>#>|\\n#>#>|Irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason. The latter has\\n#>#>|been discussed for a long time with Charley Wingate. One point is that\\n#>#>|the beliefs violate reason often, and another that a process that does\\n#>#>|not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information.\\n#>#>\\n#>#>Well, there is a glaring paradox here:  an argument that reason is useful\\n#>#>based on reason would be circular, and argument not based on reason would\\n#>#>be irrational.  Which is it?\\n#>#>\\n#>#That\\'s bogus. Self reference is not circular. And since the evaluation of\\n#>#usefulness is possible within rational systems, it is allowed.\\n#>\\n#>O.K., it\\'s oval.  It\\'s still begging the question, however.  And though\\n#>that certainly is allowed, it\\'s not rational.  And you claiming to be\\n#>rational and all.\\n#>\\n# \\n#Another of your assertions. No proof, no evidence, just claims.\\n\\nHey - I learned it from you. Did I do good?\\n# \\n# \\n#>At the risk of repeating myself, and hearing \"we had that before\" [we\\n#>didn\\'t hear a _refutation_ before, so we\\'re back.   Deal with it] :\\n#>you can\\'t use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful.  Someone\\n#>who thinks reason is crap won\\'t buy it, you see.\\n#>\\n# \\n#That is unusually weak even for you. The latter implies that my proof\\n#depends on their opinion. Somehow who does not accept that there are\\n#triangles won\\'t accept Pythagoras. Wow, that\\'s an incredible insight.\\n#I don\\'t have to prove them wrong in their opinion. It is possible to\\n#show that their systems leave out useful information respectively claims\\n#unreliable or even absurd statements to be information.\\n\\nTotally circular, and totally useless.\\n# \\n#Their wish to believe makes them believe. Things are judges by their appeal,\\n#and not by their information. It makes you feel good when you believe that\\n#may be good for them, but it contains zillions of possible pitfalls. From\\n#belief despite contrary evidence to the bogus proofs they attempt.\\n\\nTruth by blatant assertion.  I\\'ve seen as many bogus proofs of the \\nnon-existence of gods as I have of their existence.\\n\\n# \\n#Rational systems, by the way, does not mean that every data has to come from\\n#logical analysis, the point is that the evaluation of the data does not\\n#contradict logic. It easily follows that such a system does not allows to\\n#evaluate if its rational in itself. Yes, it is possible to evaluate that\\n#it is rational in a system that is not rational by the fallacies of that\\n#system, but since the validity of the axioms is agreed upon, that has as\\n#little impact as the possibility of a demon ala Descartes.\\n\\nThis just doesn\\'t parse, sorry.\\n# \\n#So far it just a matter of consistency. I use ratiional arguments to show\\n#that my system is consistent or that theirs isn\\'t. The evaluation of the\\n\\nNor this.\\n#predictions does not need rationality. It does not contradict, however.\\n# \\n# \\n#>#Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics\\n#>#and mathematics are therfore circular.\\n#>\\n#>Anybody else think Godel was silly?\\n#>\\n# \\n#Stream of consciousness typing? What is that supposed to mean?\\n# \\n# \\n#>#>The first part of the second statement contains no information, because\\n#>#>you don\\'t say what \"the beliefs\" are.  If \"the beliefs\" are strong theism\\n#>#>and/or strong atheism, then your statement is not in general true.  The\\n#>#>second part of your sentence is patently false - counterexample: an\\n#>#>axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis, but is\\n#>#>assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is\\n#>#>used to obtain it.\\n#>#>\\n#>#\\n#>#I\\'ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions\\n#>#of god here.\\n#>#\\n#>#An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis, what you say here\\n#>#is a an often refuted fallacy. Have a look at the discussion of the\\n#>#axiom of choice. And further, one can evaluate axioms in larger systems\\n#>#out of which they are usually derived. \"I exist\" is derived, if you want\\n#>#it that way.\\n#>#\\n#>#Further, one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.\\n#>#\\n#>#what is it you are trying to say?\\n#>\\n#>That at some point, people always wind up saying \"this datum is reliable\"\\n#>for no particular reason at all.  Example: \"I am not dreaming\".\\n#>\\n# \\n#Nope. There is evidence for it. The trick is that the choice of an axiomatic\\n#basis of a system is difficult, because the possibilities are interwoven.\\n#One therefore chooses that with the least assumptions or with assumptions\\n#that are necessary to get information out of the system anyway.\\n\\nI\\'d like to see this alleged evidence.\\n# \\n#One does not need to define axioms in order to define an evaluation method\\n#for usefulness, the foundation is laid by how one feels at all (that\\'s not\\n#how one feels about it).\\n\\nI see.  You have no irrational beliefs.  But then, fanatics never do, do\\nthey?\\n\\n# \\n#>#>|Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of\\n#>#>|their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational.\\n#>#>\\n#>#>I can\\'t agree with this until you are specific - *which* theism?  To\\n#>#>say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which\\n#>#>I suspect you do not have.\\n#>#>\\n#>#\\n#>#Using the traditonal definition of gods. Personal, supernatural entities\\n#>#with objective effects on this world. Usually connected to morals and/or\\n#>#the way the world works.\\n#>\\n#>IMO, any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational.  That does\\n#>not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of\\n#>intelligence.  Some atheists are also scientists, for example.\\n#>\\n# \\n#They don\\'t use theism when doing science. Or it wouldn\\'t be science. Please\\n#note that subjective data lend themselves to a scientific treatment as well.\\n#They just prohibit formulating them as objective statements.\\n\\nErgo, nothing is objective.  Fair enough.\\n# \\n# \\n#>#>|The affinity to fanatism is easily seen. It has to be true because I believe\\n#>#>|it is nothing more than a work hypothesis. However, the beliefs say they are\\n#>#>|more than a work hypothesis.\\n#>#>\\n#>#>I don\\'t understand this.  Can you formalise your argument?\\n#>#\\n#>#Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice. That does not make\\n#>#B true, it is at best a work hypothesis. However, the content of B is that\\n#>#it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis. Testing or evaluating\\n#>#evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because B (already believed)\\n#>#says it is wronG/ a waste  of time/ not possible. Depending on the further\\n#>#contents of B Amalekites/Idolaters/Protestants are to be killed, this can\\n#>#have interesting effects.\\n#>\\n#>Peculiar definition of interesting, but sure.  Now show that a belief\\n#>in gods entails the further contents of which you speak.   Why aren\\'t my\\n#>catholic neighbours out killing the protestants, for example?   Maybe they\\n#>don\\'t believe in it.  Maybe it\\'s the conjunction of \"B asserts B\" and\\n#>\"jail/kill dissenters\" that is important, and the belief in gods is\\n#>entirely irrelevant.  It certainly seems so to me, but then I have no\\n#>axe to grind here.\\n#>\\n# \\n#The example with your neighbours is a fallacy. That *your* neighbours don\\'t\\n#says little about others. And there were times when exactly that happened.\\n\\nNope, it\\'s not a fallacy.   It just doesn\\'t go to the correlation you\\nwish to see.\\n# \\n#And tell me, when it is not irrelevant, why are such statements about\\n#Amalekites and Idolaters in the Holy Books? Please note that one could\\n#edit them out when they are not relevant anymore. Because gods don\\'t err?\\n#What does that say about that message?\\n\\nExcuse me - THE Holy Books?\\n# \\n#And how come we had theists saying genocides ordered by god are ok.

If you\\'re feeling\\ncreative, and your favorite number hasn\\'t been taken already, you can\\nmake a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-\\nbase-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not\\nthat you won\\'t get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)\\n\\nOh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You\\'ll\\njust be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole\\nnet, and you\\'ll look like a clueless newbie too.\\n\\nBy now you\\'re probably asking \"So who\\'s the KotL already?\". Well, as\\nJohn Sloan notes below, that\\'s about the only real \"secret\" left around\\nhere, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,\\nnor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was\\nthe original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the\\nKotL\\'s first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely\\nwith hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-\\noriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting\\nmessages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with \"weenie\\nmailers\"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a\\nDead-Head.\\n\\n***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************\\n\\nOnce you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically\\ngroveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed\\nwork for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting\\nsomething done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)\\ndays, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of\\neconomic activity on the part of the KotL\\'s employers, sending yet\\nanother copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it\\njust makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an\\nexcersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least\\nannotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request\\nwas submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think\\nthe KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).\\n\\n***********************************************************************\\n\\nOne more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren\\'t what\\nthey used to be. So provide some information for the list, will ya?\\nThe typical DoD List entry contains number, name, state/country, &\\ne-mail address. For example:\\n\\n0111:Ed Green:CA:ed.green@East.Sun.COM\\n\\n(PS: While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only\\nrequirements for DoD membership, that\\'s not strictly true these days, as\\nthere are a number of Denizens who lack one or both.)\\n\\nBlaine (Dances With Bikers) Gardner   blgardne@javelin.sim.es.com\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n            \"Denizens of Doom\", by Bruce Tanner (DoD 0161)\\n\\n      [Road Rider, August 1991, reprinted with Bruce\\'s permission]\\n\\nThere is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal \\nthings that a bunch of bikers do.  They discuss motorcycles and  \\nmotorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  \\nhelmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve\\nseats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, \\ntraffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double \\nentendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They \\nargue with each other and plan rides together.\\n\\nThe difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, \\nalthough they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each \\nother face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world \\nand communicate with each other electronically via computer.\\n\\nThe computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  \\nthe people range from college and university students to high-tech industry \\nprofessionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, \\nrec.motorcycles (pronounced \"wreck-dot-motorcycles,\" it\\'s the file name for \\nthe group\\'s primary on-line \"meeting place\") carries about 2250 articles per \\nmonth;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent \\nposters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred \\nto as the DoD.\\n\\nThe DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of \\nparodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer \\nenthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, \"Denizen \\nof Doom.\"  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of \\nthe Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of \\ncourse, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.\\n\\nThe idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules \\nappealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the \\nList, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been \\nalmost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and \\nCanada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, \\nGermany, Norway and Finland.\\n\\nKeeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run \\nof 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the \\nAmerican Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- \\nselling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a \\nfew months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were \\ndonated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 \\nto the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs \\nin the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.\\n\\nAs often as possible, the DoD\\'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go \\nriding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of \\nDoD\\'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California\\'s \\n\"Silicon Valley.\"  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on \\nRollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California \\n\"Joust.\"\\n\\nThe Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big \\nbarbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern \\nCalifornia ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, \\nmeeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan \\nfor 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction \\nwith the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.\\n\\nThough it\\'s a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective \\ncommunications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional \\nmotorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in \\nsearch of two-wheeled camaraderie, it\\'s a great way for kindred spirits to \\nget together.  Long may they flame.\\n\\n\\n\"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live\"\\t[centerbar]\\n\\nThis official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which \\nyou can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do \\nanything like that face to face.  These insults are known as \"flames\";  \\nissuing them is called \"flaming.\"  Flames often start when a member \\ndisagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A \\ntypical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be \\nsomething like:  \"What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad \\nposeur!\"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense \\nof the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding \\nability and your cat.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_\\n\\n                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011\\n\\nPeriodically the question \"What is DoD?\" is raised. This is one of\\nthose questions in the same class as \"Why is the sky blue?\", \"If there\\nis a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?\" and \"Why do\\nwomen inevitably tell you that you\\'re such a nice guy just before they\\ndump you?\", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,\\nand philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion\\nby philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the\\nhalls of academe for generations. \\n\\nA long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few\\nminutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on\\na computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two\\nmachines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another\\nvia a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but\\nwho was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of\\nthe various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and\\nsigned it \"The Denizen of Doom\". Not wishing to identify himself, he\\nasked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time\\nbecome DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit\\nabout what other people thought and generally being a right thinking\\nindividual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. \\n\\nHe who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was\\nthe funniest thing he\\'d seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty\\neasily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom\\nMotorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership\\nnumber. \\n\\nPerhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a\\nmotorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or\\nmake or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized\\nelectronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a\\npart of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a\\ngestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the\\nsum of its parts.  It could also be that we\\'re all computer nerds who\\nwear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen\\nto also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight\\nratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open\\nminded enough to accept us as members. \\n\\nIn a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom\\nMotorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have\\nnever met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet\\nfeel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some\\nof the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized\\nand run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the\\nnetwork via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list\\n(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the\\nsame region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating\\naround the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by\\n#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and\\ndistributed on VHS by #18)! \\n\\nWhere will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,\\nplacing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine\\nmanagement computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each\\nparticipant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?\\nWill the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal\\nroom and at least a 386-sized UNIX system?

A lone figure, whom we\\'ll call\\nChuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white CDC lab coat,\\nwith 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.] \\n\\n(editor\\'s note: For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at\\nthe First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizens\\nreferring to each other as \"Chuck\". I guess you had to be there. I\\nwasn\\'t.) \\n\\nChuck:  I didn\\'t want to be a Software Systems Analyst,\\n cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,\\n may-I-have-another-sir.  My mother made me do it.  I wanted\\n to live a man\\'s life,\\n[Music slowly builds in background]\\n riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes\\n and the deepest valleys,\\n living the life of a Motorcyclist;\\n doing donuts and evading the police;\\n terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;\\n eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).

And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.\\n\\nSometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: \"What does DoD\\nstand for? It\\'s not the Department of Defense is it?\" Naturally, a\\nDenizen who had watched the movie \"Top Gun\" a few times too many rose\\nto the occasion and replied:\\n\\n\"That\\'s classified, we could tell you, but then we\\'d have to kill you.\"\\n\\nAnd the rest is history.\\n\\nA variation on the \"security\" theme is to supply disinformation about\\nwhat DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where\\nknown) include:\\n\\nDaughters of Democracy (DoD 23)\\t\\tDoers of Donuts\\nDancers of Despair (DoD 9)\\t\\tDebasers of Daughters\\nDickweeds of Denver\\t\\t\\tDriveway of Death\\nDebauchers of Donuts\\t\\t\\tDumpers of Dirtbikes\\n\\nNote that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be\\nlimited only by the contents of one\\'s imagination or dictionary file.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                     The rec.moto.photo archive\\n\\nFirst a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck\\nRogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,\\nand several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in\\nunknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate\\nfor an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not\\nonly provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken\\nthe time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.\\n\\nNot only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk\\nat their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the\\nserver too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,\\nthe general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.\\n\\nHere are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how\\nto use the archive.\\n\\n**********************************************************\\n\\nVia ftp:\\n\\ncerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]\\n\\nVia e-mail:\\n\\nThe address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the\\nmessage.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The\\narguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For\\nrec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:\\n\\ndir [dod]\\nsend [dod]bruce_tanner.gif\\nsend [dod]dodframe.ps\\n\\nand you\\'ll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts\\nof bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.\\n\\nOh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to\\nthe next whole file) are send.  A \\'send [dod]*.gif\\' would send 150 files of\\n50K each; not a good idea.\\n-- \\nBruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDU\\nCerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner\\n\\n**********************************************************\\n\\nA couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so\\nwhy not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?\\nSecond, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind\\nof you to access it after normal working hours (California time). \\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                      Patches? What patches?\\n\\nYou may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &\\npins. And your reaction was probably: \"I want!\", or \"That\\'s sick!\", or\\nperhaps \"That\\'s sick! I want!\"\\n\\nWell, there\\'s some good news and some bad news. The good news is that\\nthere\\'s been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad\\nnews is that there isn\\'t anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn\\'t\\nbecause of any \"exclusivity\" attempt, but simply because there is no\\n\"DoD store\" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by\\nindividual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is\\nsomeone says \"I\\'m thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they\\'ll cost\\n$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?\" Then\\norders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the\\npre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a\\nDoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or\\nproduce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all\\nthis is anarchy in action.\\n\\nHere\\'s a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and\\nperpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),\\nmotorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts\\n(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and\\npatches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by\\npopular demand].\\n\\nAll \"profits\" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association\\nMotorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been\\ncontributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,\\nyou\\'ll see a large plaque on the Founders\\' Wall in the name of \"Denizens\\nof Doom, USENET, The World\", complete with a DoD pin.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHere\\'s a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.\\n\\n~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles\\n~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>\\n~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum\\n~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT\\n\\nI received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,\\nthe other day.\\n\\n\"Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:\\n\\nCongratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the\\nDenizens of Doom!

Rides:\\n\\nSummer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third\\nyear, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass\\ntrip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got\\ntogether for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north\\nas NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of\\nNorth Carolina.  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great\\nPacific Northwest Dryside Gather (GPNDG), another successful excuse for\\nriding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have\\ncome to know so well.  [Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition.]\\n\\nAlso worth mentioning are: The first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the\\nMoab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah. Riders from 5 states showed up,\\nriding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal\\n2-strokes.  And though it\\'s not an \"official\" (as if anything could be\\nofficial with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races\\nin Steamboat Springs, Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters\\nto gather.  There\\'s also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah.\\nEuropean Denizens have staged some gathers too.

As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5\\nyears. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series (\\'85-\\'89), the PI\\n(\\'88-\\'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D\\'s - \\'86-\\'90), the Power\\nSeries parallel systems (\\'88-\\'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a\\nparticular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics\\narchitectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every\\n18 months to 2 years.\\n\\nThese are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become\\nalmost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new\\nplatform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,\\nfaster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we\\ndon\\'t, we become uncompetitive.\\n\\nFrom the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your\\ncurrent needs and makes economic sense today.  You can\\'t wait to buy, but\\nif you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep\\nfor one in writing. If it\\'s feasible, they should be able to do that. Some\\nof our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as\\nthe Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series\\nmultiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain\\na guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge\\nR4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.\\n\\n|> \\n|> Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to\\n|> keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself\\n|> pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books\\n|> just before the end of the quarter), but I\\'m just a little tired of\\n|> getting boned in the process.\\n|> \\n\\nIf that\\'s happening, it\\'s becausing of misunderstandings or\\nmis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our\\ncustomer base.\\n\\n|> Maybe it\\'s because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we\\n|> aren\\'t entitled to a \"peek under the covers\" as the Big Kids (NASA,\\n|> for instance) are.

For sanity\\'s sake we must assume, if we believe in Him at all,\\nthat His message comes through somehow.  The question is whether it comes \\nthrough immediately to every individual, or is contained in a complex \\ncanon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another, \\nor is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free\\nto interpret, extend and modify the canon.  If God\\'s message is indeed\\nmediated, the further problem arises as to whether the individual under-\\nstands the mediated message fully and clearly.  Since the responsibility \\nfor understanding lies ultimately with the individual, we must assume that \\nGod in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source \\nfor that individual, whereof the person may or may not drink. \\n \\n>>Metaphysically, if there are multiple moral codes then there is no\\n>>Absolute moral code, and I think this is theologically questionable.\\n \\n>No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple\\n>moral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\\n>code. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child\\n>may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\\n>the child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in\\n>the pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is if\\n>the child disobeys the parent.

The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that\\n>he is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but\\n>you get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive\\n>as absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.\\n \\nYour example is complicated in our age by the thin line between morality\\nand politeness.  You might have said \"burp\", for burping and swearing carry\\nabout the same stigma today.  If you are talking about \"taking the Lord\\'s \\nname in vain\" as a serious transgression, then this example is more a case of \\nhypocrisy than of varying moral codes.\\n \\nIf there is an absolute moral code, propositions or laws in that code apply\\nabsolutely and universally, by definition.  Conceivably some moral codes\\ncould be subsets of the universal code, as you say at the outset.  So, for\\nexample, God\\'s code could include, \"Thou shalt not create Beings without\\na hospitable planet to live on\", but this law would be inapplicable to us.\\nNevertheless, we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicable\\nto us are also applicable to God.\\n \\nBut when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God\\'s moral code, you have\\na sense of the absurdity of the question.

I just bought the new soundblaster 16 and tried to \\ninstall the card. The sb16 uses 16bit DMA channel.I could\\nselect between channel 5 to 7. It is the first card I ever\\ninstalled that uses 16bit dma transfer. After I tested\\nthe card the first time, the computer crashed and I got a\\nparity error-system halted. This happens either from dos as\\nalso from windows. So it seems that my 16 bit dma channels\\nare not working properly (they are there because testsb16.exe\\nrecocnize them and tests them ok until first access). \\n\\nWell, does anybody know a solution for this problem or a\\nspecial test program for dma problems?

Those are\\nwhat control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have\\nthe 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:\\n\\n              5 + +    open\\n              6 + +    open             \\n              7 + +    open        \\n              8 + +    open\\n              4 + +    closed\\n              3 + +    closed\\n              2 + +    open\\n              1 + +    open\\n\\n    Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.\\nTop to bottom.   +\\'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8\\nselect the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the\\nsecond drive (drive 1).   \\n\\n      If you have the 62-000094 rom, it\\'s a auto-config, and I\\'ll have\\nto look up how to do it... I don\\'t have the big book right here.\\n\\n>2.)\\tAre the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly?\\n\\n      See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not\\nright.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables\\nare on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it\\nto the opposite side of the drive.    It\\'s one or the other.   \\n     The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I\\'ve thrown it on J3 a few\\ntimes and banged my head for a day.....\\n\\n>3.)\\tIs my system\\'s BIOS in need of an upgrade?\\n\\n     Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way\\nto check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:\\n       \\n        -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)\\n   \\n    This will return the rom date, if it\\'s of any use.\\n\\n>Keith Rice\\n\\n      If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.

Sophisticated\\nencryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\\nexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\\nactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\\nbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\\nelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\\nenforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\\nprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\\nencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\\ninnovative approaches.\\n\\nIn the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\\ndeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\\nencryption that is substantially more robust than the current\\ngovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\\nto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\\nwill allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\\nonly with appropriate legal authorization.\\n\\nTo assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\\nand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\\ninformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\\n\\nINSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\\n\\nThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\\nshall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\\nincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\\nkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\\nenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\\nthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\\nensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\\nmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\\nhardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\\nsecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\\nnot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\\ngovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\\nare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\\nescrow system.\\n\\nKEY-ESCROW\\n\\nThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\\nentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\\ninstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\\nholder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\\nunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\\nto government agencies that have established their authority to\\nacquire the content of those communications that have been\\nencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\\nGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\\nan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\\ncommunications.\\n\\nPROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\\n\\nThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\\nU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\\nfacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\\nwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\\nthat process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this\\nprocess to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of\\na final standard within six months of this directive. \\n\\nThe Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to\\nthe extent needed to preserve the government\\'s ability to conduct\\nlawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure\\nlaw enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General\\nshall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture\\nSuper Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.\\n',\n",

For another example, read on:\\n\\nIn the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort\\nby Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple\\'s attention a problem with\\ncertain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice \"stick\" in\\nthe down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the\\nmachine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the\\nreported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of\\nBCGA65431. You\\'ll recognize this \"sticky button\" symptom immediately if you\\nhave such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it\\'s not subtle.\\n\\nLiam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead \\nsuggested that people contact Apple\\'s Customer Assistance Center directly\\n(_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described\\nmy defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told\\nApple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of\\nwarranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering\\nwhere my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the\\nserial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed)\\nrange Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.\\n\\nNothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make\\nit worth Apple\\'s while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice.\\nPlease, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don\\'t assume you\\nknow what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start\\nhacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it.\\nPlease take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:\\n\\n                  United States      1-800-776-2333\\n                  Canada             800-665-2775\\n                  UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01\\n                  Australia          61-2-452-8000\\n                  Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500\\n\\nIf the number isn\\'t toll-free, call collect.  Describe the problem and ask\\nfor a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse, insist that they register\\nthe details of your case, including your mouse\\'s serial number.  Be firm.\\n\\nNetwork managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your user\\nbases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please don\\'t send mail to\\nme or post yet another \"sticky-button\" report, CALL APPLE DIRECTLY!  If\\nenough victims take the trouble to report this well-known problem, Apple\\nwill eventually be forced to respond.  If Apple continues to find it easy\\nto stone-wall on this issue, don\\'t expect them to offer support when the\\nnext, potentially more serious Mac defect is uncovered.\\n\\n-- Bill Sloan\\n',\n",

As I mentioned in the Tradition\\n# cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory\\n# about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the \"evil\"\\n# which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as \"satanic.\"\\n\\n     Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is\\n     metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not\\n     the same way?\\n\\n# The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane\\n# in human language is something like describing \"color\" to a person\\n# who has been blind from birth.  You may want to read the book\\n# FLATLAND (if you haven\\'t already) or THE DRAGON\\'S EGG.  The first\\n# is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con-\\n# cept...\\n\\n[some deleted for space saving]\\n\\n# When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe\\n# another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then\\n# such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be\\n# necessary.  The \"unseen\" is described in terms which have reference`\\n# and meaning for the reader/listener.  But, like all models, a compro-\\n# mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness\\n# of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all\\n# crippled.  But what else can you do?\\n\\n     This is why I asked the above.  How would you then\\n     know God exists as a spirit or being rather than\\n     just being metaphorical?  I mean, it\\'s okay to say\\n     \"well, Satan is just metaphorical,\" but then you\\n     have to justify this belief AND justify that God is\\n     not some metaphor for something else.\\n\\n     I say this because there are many, many instances of\\n     Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in \\n     the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the\\n     New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is\\n     described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know\\n     one is metaphorical and not the other.\\n\\n     Further, belief in God isn\\'t a bar to evil.  Let\\'s\\n     consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were\\n     metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe\\n     in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a \\n     case where someone does believe in God, but by\\n     religious standards, they are \"evil.\"  If Bobby\\n     does see this, let him address this question also.\\n\\n[deleted some more on \"metaphor\"]\\n\\n>> Obviously more philosophizing on this issue is possible, but I\\'m\\n>> not sure that the readers of this newsgroup would want to delve\\n>> into religious interpretation further.

Apparently land-based\\n>beacons tranmit GPS correction information to your GPS \\n>receiver (with differential option installed).\\n\\n>How does this system work?  What frequency is used for\\n>the land-based beacons?\\n\\n>Thanks in advance,\\n\\n>Charlie Thompson\\n>.\\n\\nHere\\'s a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station\\nwith a very exactly known position computes the errors in the\\nincoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors\\nincluding atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time\\ndithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational \\nequipment to \"back out\" the errors in its position (since it knows\\nwhere it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a \\nbroadcast which is available to any number of relatively local\\nreceivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using\\nthe same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very\\nsimilar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the\\nreceiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference\\nunit.\\n\\nThe US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series\\nof coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will\\nuse existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately\\n305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals\\non different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers\\ncorrection signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system\\nwhich has stations all across the US.\\n\\nThe correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.\\nAdvertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJohn P.

Which is why I only go\\nby the Pentecost use where it\\'s an actual language.\\n\\nMoreover, the phrase \"though I speak with the tongues of men and angels\"\\nused by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would then\\nassume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, it\\nis no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.\\n\\nHmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see how\\nGod PUNISHED by giving us different language.

It\\'s disturbing to think that some people find ways to \\njustify jabbering.\\n\\nBut I\\'ll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned.\\n\\nTrouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts at\\nverification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that\\nthe witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outright\\nfabrication was involved.

The estimated population\\n of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were\\n Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.\\n Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third\\n of Transcaucasia\\'s Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \\n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province\\'s ethnic character \\n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \\n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \\n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \\n (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4.

Our troops surrounded village after village. \\n Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts \\n into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable \\n and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets \\n completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \\n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \\n into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole \\n length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \\n Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \\n plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \\n Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for \\n howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the \\n scattered bones of the dead.\" \\n\\n                             Ohanus Appressian\\n                            \"Men Are Like That\"\\n                                   p. 202.\\n\\n\\n SOME OF THE REFERENCES FROM EMINENT AUTHORS IN THE FIELD OF MIDDLE-EASTERN\\n HISTORY AND EYEWITNESSES OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE OF 2.5 MILLION MUSLIMS\\n\\n1. \"The Armenian Revolutionary Movement\" by Louise Nalbandian,\\n   University of California Press, Berkeley, Los Angeles, 1975\\n\\n2. \"Diplomacy of Imperialism 1890-1902\" by William I.

Lots of work, and imminent graduation have come in the way of \\nposting one of these for March or earlier this month -- for which I apologize.\\n\\nThis file includes information on writing a script for University of Minnesota\\nPHONE, and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with \\nPHONE. \\n\\nFor additions, modifications and corrections, I can be reached at\\n<ashok@biochemistry.cwru.edu>\\n\\nBest wishes,\\nAshok\\n\\n-- begin SLIP.TXT --\\nBased on my experiences on setting up SLIP under DOS and Windows,  here\\nare my comments on setting up SLIP in this environment.  I thank the\\nTrumpet beta testers and the CWRU SLIP beta testers for their comments.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nConfiguring your Modem:\\n\\na) Turn off DTR (AT&D0&W)\\n   I have to disable DTR because the communication program that I use\\n   to dial my SLIP server (QMODEM) drops DTR when I exit the program\\n   and therefore hangs up the line.  If you use a program like Kermit\\n   or Conex to establish the SLIP connection, then this need not be done.\\n   These programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit.\\n\\n   NOTE: If you use Univ. of Minn. PHONE to dial and establish a\\n         SLIP connection, you do not need to turn off DTR.\\n\\nb) Dial and establish the SLIP connection first.  This can be done\\n   automatically if you use a program like PHONE (from the University of\\n   Minnesota) which will dial and establish a SLIP connection then load the\\n   SLIP packet driver.  The PHONE scripting language is simple and\\n   phone scripts can be easily written to configure PHONE to work with\\n   other SLIP server.  In addition, while the only packet driver\\n   that PHONE works with is UMSLIP (currently), it is easy to write a\\n   batch file hack that lets PHONE work with other packet drivers.\\n   There is a section on PHONE in the document with both script and\\n   batch file examples.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nConfiguring the SLIP drivers:\\n\\nThere are five SLIP packet drivers commonly available\\nCSLIPPER.EXE    Peter Tattam\\'s compressed SLIP driver\\nSLIPPER.EXE     Peter Tattam\\'s SLIP driver\\nSLIP8250.COM    Crynwr driver (I like Phil Burn\\'s modified driver)\\nETHERSL.COM     Crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over SLIP)\\nUMSLIP.COM      Univ. of Minnesota driver (based on SLIP8250)\\n\\nOf these four, I vastly prefer C/SLIPPER.EXE over SLIP8250.COM or\\nETHERSL.COM for the following reasons:\\n\\na) It is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 UART\\nb) While using EtherSLIP/SLIP8250/UMSLIP, myself and several others\\n   have noticed that the PC clock gets messed up after performing a\\n   long FTP transfer.\\nc) It supports PKTMUX when used in ethernet simulation mode\\nd) When used in Ethernet simulation mode C/SLIPPER seem to work with\\n   every TCP/IP application that I have tested it with.\\n\\nInstructions for C/SLIPPER.EXE (and you do not use PHONE)\\na) Load SLIPPER in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file according to instructions:\\n   For instance if you have a v.32bis modem on COM1\\n   slipper com1 vec=62 baud=57600\\nb) If you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Win 3.1 DOS boxes, then use the\\n   double-ended packet driver shim WinPKT.COM -- this creates a virtual\\n   packet driver at 0x60.  DOS applications in native mode, DOS\\n   applications in Windows 3.1 DOS boxes and Windows applications can all\\n   use this virtual driver at 0x60.\\n   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62\\nc) If you use QVT/Net, load PKTINT.COM next.  QVT/net is configured in\\n   QVTNET.INI to use the interrupt at 0x60.\\n   pktint.com\\n\\nInstructions for SLIP8250.COM:\\na) Try getting a version 10 SLIP driver.  Philip Burns of Northwestern\\n   University has a modified SLIP8250.COM driver that is better at hardware\\n   handshaking.  This driver is distributed along with NuPOP.\\nb) Load the driver AFTER establishing the SLIP connection.  My modem is a\\n   V.32bis modem on COM1, so here is how I would load the driver.\\n   slip8250 -w 0x62 -h 4 SLIP 0x03f8 57600\\nc) As discussed above if you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Windows 3.x\\n   DOS boxes, you probably want to use WINPKT.COM\\n   winpkt.com 0x60 0x62\\nd) If you use WinQVT/net, load PKTINT.COM\\n   pktint.com\\n\\nInstructions for ETHERSL.COM:\\nIf you choose to use ETHERSL.COM instead of SLIP8250.COM, the\\ninstructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference.  You\\nwill have to DELETE the line \"device=*vcd\" from the [386Enh] section\\nof SYSTEM.INI.  This will interfere with running regular Windows Comm\\napplications (such as Crosstalk), and you will get lots of dropped\\ncharacters etc. in these applications.  This is therefore not\\nrecommended.  ETHERSLIP would be loaded as:\\n   ethersl -w 0x62 -h 4 0x03f8 57600\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nConfiguring Windows 3.1:\\n\\na) Make the following modifications to the SYSTEM.INI file [386Enh]\\n   section.\\n   i) List all your COM ports, with their addresses and interrupts.\\n       COM1Base=03F8\\n       COM1Irq=4\\n       COM2Base=02F8\\n       COM2Irq=3\\n       COM3Base=03E8\\n       COM3Irq=5\\n       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel,\\n       but double-clicking on the \"Ports\" icon.\\n   ii) Give the port to which your modem is attached a generous COM buffer\\n       COM1Buffer=10000\\n   iii) Change the COM port AutoAssign value for the COM port that you wish\\n       to use for your modem to ZERO.  This is the amount of time that\\n       Windows waits in seconds before handing control of that COM port to\\n       another application.  If you use WinQVT/net and then want to switch\\n       from one session to another, and this value is at the default value\\n       of 2 seconds, you are will get a GPF and Windows will crash.\\n       COM1AutoAssign=0\\n       This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel.\\n       Double-click on 386 Enhanced, and under \"Device Contention\", set\\n       the device contention for the COM port your modem is on to\\n       \"Never Warn\"\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nAdditional notes:\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWhat to do if you are assigned a different IP address for each\\nSLIP session?\\n\\nI am fortunate in that our campus SLIP server assigns each user\\na permanent IP address, so I do not have worry about editing QVTNET.INI\\neach time that I establish a SLIP connection.\\n\\nIf you are assigned a new IP address on every occasion that you dial in,\\nplease try to use BOOTP aware software, and let BOOTP do the\\nconfiguration for you.  However, QVTnet is not BOOTP aware and RARP\\nwill not work over a SLIP connection.  To get QVTNet working in a\\nsituation such as this, you must do the following:\\n\\nEdit the QVTNET.INI file.  Let the [net] section look like this:\\n\\n[net]\\nname=\\nip=\\nnetmask=255.255.255.0 (or whatever is appropriate for you)\\narptime=20\\npacket_vector=60 (or whatever is appropriate)\\n\\nSave the changes, and then *write-protect* this file\\n\"attrib +r qvtnet.ini\"\\n\\nStart your slip connection, and *remember* the name and IP address\\nthat you are assigned.  Each time you start QVT/net 3.1x, the\\ngeneral configuration dialog box will open.  Enter the name and\\nIP address and you were assigned for that session, click on [OK],\\nand you should be up and running.  The changes you make will not\\nbe saved, as QVTNET.INI is write-protected.\\n\\nA more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic SLIP IP address\\nassignment is provided by Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)\\nVictor uses the program bootpq to semi-automate qvtnet preparation.\\nBootpq is used to inquire the assigned IP, which is then saved to a\\nfile called \"myip\".  Another file \"noip\" is essentially a complete\\nQVTNET.INI file that lacks the IP address.  In the final step \"myip\"\\nand \"noip\" are copied into a single QVTNET.INI file.  An example of\\nVictor\\'s batch file is provided below:\\n=====================================================\\nslipper com2\\npktint.com\\nbootpq -i \"ip=\\\\\"%%s\\\\\"\"  >> myip\\nbootpq -i \"My IP# is: %s\"\\ncopy /q net + myip + noip e:\\\\com\\\\qvtnet\\\\qvtnet.ini\\ndel /q myip\\n@echo off\\necho .\\necho Ready to run WinQVTnet\\n=====================================================\\nFor questions and more details about bootpq, please contact Victor\\nMenayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)\\n\\nQPC Software is attempting to add BOOTP capability to WinQVT/net.\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nHow do you use PKTMUX over SLIP?\\n\\nPKTMUX will not work over the SLIP8250.COM packet driver, and crashes\\nimmediately if used with ETHERSL.COM\\n\\nPKTMUX will work with C/SLIPPER.EXE, when C/SLIPPER is used in ethernet\\nsimulation mode.  An example of this configuration is shown below:\\n\\nThe latest release of PKTMUX is 1.2c; and it is important that you\\nuse this version, if you want to use virtual packet drivers with\\napplications like Trumpet for Windows (to be released very shortly).\\n\\n[from AUTOEXEC.BAT]\\n\\nlh c/slipper com1 vec=65 baud=57600 ether         (packet driver)\\nlh pktmux 5 65 /5       (pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers)\\nlh pktdrv 7f 65         (first virtual packet driver used for QVT/net)\\nlh pktint.com           (QVT/net pktint.com)\\npktdrv 63 65            (PKTDRV for use in native DOS or WinTrumpet)\\n\\nAdditional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within\\nWindows 3.1 DOS boxes.  For example, my PIF file to load POPmail is\\ndirected to the file \"popmail.bat\".  This is what popmail.bat reads\\nlike:\\n\\npktdrv 60 65            loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60\\ncd \\\\popmail\\npopmail\\ncd \\\\\\npktdrv 60 /u            unloads the packet driver at 0x60\\nexit                    causes the DOS window to close\\n\\nI have similar batch files that load other DOS TCP/IP applications\\nlike PC Gopher.  It is my experience that PKTMUX works fine\\neven if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual DOS\\nsessions, are loaded at the same software interrupt.  For example\\nwithin two different DOS boxes -- one for POPmail and the other for\\nGopher, the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at 0x60 in each\\ninstance.\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nHow much does PKTMUX degrade the performance of C/SLIPPER?\\n\\nI have a V.32bis/V.42bis modem in a 386-33 running Windows 3.1 with\\na reasonably fast video card (ATI Graphics Ultra).  Under these\\nconditions, when I have three virtual packet drivers loaded and\\nbeing used as follows:\\na) Driver at 0x7f -- QVTNet FTP client session\\nb) Driver at 0x60 in one DOS Window -- CUTCP tn3270 session\\nc) Driver at 0x60 in another DOS Window -- Trumpet for DOS\\n\\nI get FTP transfer rates of 0.8 - 1.0 kb/sec while transferring\\ncompressed files.  This rate is comparable to that which I get with\\nSLIP8250 loaded as a packet driver, and where a single TCP/IP session\\nis active.  If CSLIPPER is used a packet driver and a single session\\nis active, I get transfer rates of 1.3 - 1.4 kb/sec on the same\\nfiles.\\n\\nWhile there is about 40% degradation in the performance of SLIPPER,\\nfor me the benefits of being able to use PKTMUX outweigh the\\nperformance hit.\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nC/SLIPPER and ethernet simulation mode\\n\\nIn ethernet simulation mode, C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 works with all the\\napplications that I have tested it with.  One or two applications\\nthat required ethernet simulation balked at C/SLIPPER 1.2, but even\\nthese rare problems have been resolved with ver 1.3\\n\\nWhen SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode, and used with PKTMUX,\\nI get some an error message in the QVTNet Console window that reads\\n\"IP:incorrect packet type\" or \"IP:bad version number\".  This does not\\nseem to prevent QVTnet from functioning, although I cannot comment on\\nloss of performance.\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWhat can you do if your DOS TCP/IP application does not work with\\nC/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode?\\n\\nIn the rare event that you find a package that does not work with\\nC/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode, first contact the author --\\nPeter Tattam -- PETER@psychnet.psychol.utas.edu.au, and let him\\nknow.  Chances are that he can fix it.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile, you can try the following.  I do not know if it is\\nkosher, but it worked when I had problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.2\\n\\n(C/SLIPPER is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the PKTMUX section)\\n\\nI load ETHERSL.COM at 0x60, run the application and then terminate\\nETHERSL.COM\\n\\nThis also works within Windows 3.1 virtual DOS boxes.  However a\\npacket driver like ETHERSL can be used in only one virtual DOS box\\nat a time.\\n\\nSo for example, here is my batch file to run Grateful Med (a\\nmedical reference retrieval program developed at the National Library\\nof Medicine).\\n\\nethersl -w 0x60 -h 4 0x03f8 57600       loads ETHERSLIP\\ncd \\\\gm6\\nsearch\\ncd \\\\\\ntermin 0x60                             terminates ETHERSLIP\\nexit            closes the DOS box and returns me to Windows\\n\\nIf you use this method, be cautious about one thing -- don\\'t have\\nany active PKTMUX DOS sessions open at the same time.  After closing\\nthe ETHERSL window, you can run your PKTMUX DOS sessions with no\\nproblem.  BTW, the example above -- Grateful Med, works with no\\nproblems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.3\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nPHONE Script Files:\\n\\nThe documentation that accompany PHONE, provide good instructions on\\nwriting script files to get PHONE to dial SLIP servers other than\\nthe University of Minnesota server.  For example here is a script\\nthat I use to dial a CISCO server at the University that I attend.\\n\\nBackground:  To start a SLIP connection, I dial our terminal server,\\nand login with a username and password.  After doing so, I start a SLIP\\nsession with the following command \"slip username-slip.dialin.cwru.edu\",\\nfollowed by my password -- again.\\n\\nHere then is the relevant portion of the PHONE.CMD script file -\\n#\\n# CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script by Ashok Aiyar 3/26/93\\n# Last revised 3/28/93\\nProcedure    Host.CWRU.Login\\nTimeOut 60      \\'CWRU-TS2 terminal server is not responding\\'\\nMessage         \"CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script -- Version 1.1\"\\nMessage         \\'Waiting for SLIP server to respond\\'\\nQuiet ON\\nExpect \\'Verification\\'\\nMessage         \\'Request for User Verification Received from CWRU-TS2\\'\\nMessage         \\'Sending your user name and password\\'\\nQuiet OFF\\nExpect   \\'Username:\\'\\nSend \\'%u<\\'\\nExpect   \\'Password:\\'\\nPrivate\\nSend \\'%p<\\'\\nReject    \\'Access denied\\'   \\'Your user name or password was not accepted\\'\\nTimeOut 30    \\'SLIP server did not respond to your validation request\\'\\nExpect \\'CWRU-TS2>\\'\\nSend \\'SLIP<\\'\\nTimeOut 10    \\'SLIP server did not respond to SLIP command\\'\\nExpect \\'IP hostname or address:\\'\\nSend \\'%u-slip.dialin.cwru.edu<\\'\\nTimeOut 10 \\'SLIP server did not respond to hostname\\'\\nReject    \\'Bad IP address\\'   \\'Incorrect Hostname\\'\\nExpect \\'Password:\\'\\nSend \\'%p<\\'\\nReject    \\'Access denied\\'    \\'Password not accepted.\\'\\nTimeOut 10\\nExpect \\'Header Compression will match your system\\'\\nMessage \\'Login to CWRU SLIP server successful\\'\\nWait 1.0\\nEndProcedure   Host.CWRU.Login\\n#\\n#\\nProcedure      Host.CWRU.LogOut\\n# Nothing special needs to be done to logout\\nEndProcedure   Host.CWRU.LogOut\\n#\\n#   End of Script file\\n#\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nHow to use packet drivers other than UMSLIP with PHONE?\\n\\nThe quick answer -- there is no \"clean\" way.  Below is a batch file\\nhack that I wrote to use PHONE with other packet drivers.  In this\\nexample, the packet driver is Peter Tattam\\'s CSLIPPER.  To use a\\nbatch file like this, you must know the parameters with which you\\nplan to use the packet driver -- i.e interrupt vector, baud rate,\\nport address, and IRQ.  This batch file requires UMSLIP.COM,\\nCSLIPPER.EXE, and TERMIN.COM to be in the same directory\\nor in your path ...\\n\\nAll that the BATCH file does is to let you dial the SLIP connection\\nusing PHONE, load the appropriate packet driver, hangup the\\nconnection, and unload the driver when you are done ...\\n\\n-- being CWRUSLIP.BAT --\\n@echo off\\nrem   this batch file is an ugly hack of U. of Minn. \"SLIP.BAT\"\\nrem   awaiting a version of C/SLIPPER that can directly interact\\nrem   with PHONE\\nrem   CWRUSLIP.BAT file is used with PHONE.EXE to start a SLIP\\nrem   connection on CWRU-TS2\\nrem   last modified 3/28/93 -- Ashok Aiyar\\n\\n@echo off\\ncls\\ngoto start\\n\\n:start\\nif %1. == ?.         goto help\\nif %1. == help.      goto help\\nif %1. == setup.     goto setup\\nif %1. == dial.      goto forceD\\nif %1. == hangup.    goto forceH\\nif %1. == quit.      goto forceH\\nif %1. == HELP.      goto help\\nif %1. == SETUP.     goto setup\\nif %1. == DIAL.      goto forceD\\nif %1. == QUIT.      goto forceH\\ngoto bogus\\ngoto unload\\n\\n:forceH\\ntermin 0x60\\numslip >nul\\nphone force hangup\\ngoto unload\\n\\n:slipper\\ntermin 0x60\\nREM  the following line must be changed to reflect the COM port,\\nREM  IRQ, baud rate, and software interrupt\\nlh c:\\\\packet\\\\cslipper com1 vec=60 baud=57600 ether\\ngoto end\\n\\n:forceD\\ntermin 0x60\\numslip >nul\\nphone force dial\\ngoto slipper\\n\\n:setup\\ntermin 0x60\\numslip >nul\\nphone setup\\ngoto help\\n\\n:unload\\ntermin 0x60\\ngoto end\\n\\n:bogus\\necho %1 is not a valid command.\\necho Try \"cwruslip help\" for a list of valid commands\\necho.\\n\\n:help\\necho --------------------------------------------------------------\\necho           Case Western Reserve University SLIP Setup\\necho                  using Univ. of Minnesota PHONE\\necho --------------------------------------------------------------\\necho cwruslip setup     modem settings, phone number, username etc.\\necho.\\necho cwruslip dial      DIAL and establish the SLIP connection\\necho cwruslip quit      HANGUP the phone and unload the driver\\necho cwruslip help      this screen\\necho.\\n\\n:end\\n-- end CWRUSLIP.BAT --\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWhere to Get What.....\\n\\nPeter Tattam\\'s programs are archived at ftp.utas.edu.au (C/SLIPPER,\\nand the Trumpet set of programs).\\n\\nWinQVT/net is generally archived at most Windows FTP sites,\\nincluding ftp.cica.indiana.edu\\n\\nNCSA Telnet is archived at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu\\n\\nNuPOP is archived at ftp.acns.nwu.edu\\n\\nPOPmail/PC, SLIPDISK, PHONE, and PC Gopher are archived at\\nboombox.micro.umn.edu\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n-- end SLIP.TXT --\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\nAshok Aiyar                        Mail: ashok@biochemistry.cwru.edu\\nDepartment of Biochemistry                       Tel: (216) 368-3300\\nCWRU School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio         Fax: (216) 368-4544\\n',\n",

All compliant diesels are turbocharged.\\n2. All use an \"aftercooler\", which cools the air which was heated\\n   by compression by the turbocharger (up to about 25 PSI).\\n3. A gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air\\n   intake, and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is\\n   low.\\n\\nNo scrubbers, catalytic converters, etc, are used.  The path from\\nthe turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free.\\n\\nInterestingly, except for the low-pressure fuel limitation, power output \\nand mileage are enhanced by these measures.  One can buy aftermarket\\nturbos and aftercoolers which generate more power, lots more power,\\nand these are approved by the CARB.\\n\\nDan Hepner\\n',\n",

While most\\n  leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the \\n  economy, there has been no corresponding improvement in the area\\n  of jobs creation.\\n\\n  The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark.  last month,\\n  in an effort to understand this problem, President Clinton appointed\\n  a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting\\n  economic signals.  This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore.\\n\\n  Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion.\\n  \"It\\'s the guns\" Vice President Gore said.  Apparently NRA members, and other\\n  \"gun-nuts\" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the\\n  economy out of the recession.  \"Their buying them five times faster than\\n  ever before, and stockpiling left and right\", the Vice President said.  \\n\\n  However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have\\n  been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several\\n  declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have\\n  not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.\\n\\n  \"We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people\", said\\n  the President of Colt industries.  \"As long as Clinton is in office, we\\n  suspect it will\", he added.\\n\\n  In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new\\n  Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It\\'s \\n  called the \"Ban-One-A-Month\" Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law,\\n  every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index \\n  cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw\\n  one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any\\n  further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the\\n  politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.\\n\\n  The President said, \"This law will benefit America two ways.  When the\\n  Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run\\n  out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.  In addition,\\n  over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the\\n  street.\"  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee\\n  this program, citing her \"Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject\\n  of gun control\".\\n\\n  Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an\\n  amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing\\n  caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  \"Their stockpiling,\\n  stockpiling, stockpiling\" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference\\n  at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.\\n\\n  Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment\\n  that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been\\n  drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying, \"First we\\'ll\\n  fuck em, then we\\'ll kick em out of bed in the morning\", during a press\\n  conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate\\n  building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow\\n  the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require\\n  the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,\\n  after all of the cards have been drawn.\\n\\n  The head of the BATF responded by saying, \"We will have to see if this\\n  thing in Waco is over by then.  We may be too busy to seize all those\\n  guns\".\\n\\n  US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado\\n  declared this proposed law as being \"reasonable gun control which won\\'t\\n  affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns\".\\n\\n  - end article -\\n\\n  For the humor impaired :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-) \\n\\n                                Bill Vojak\\n                                vojak@icebucket.stortek.com\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNRA, ILA,\\n                                Colorado Firearms Coalition\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nThe CBS Nightly Propaganda With Dan Rather.

Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on\\nNHL teams have escalated to the following stats:\\n\\nCanadians: 400\\nAmericans: 100\\nEuropeans: 100\\n\\n   Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top\\n25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.\\n\\n   Here\\'s the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick\\nof watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let\\'s say, the\\nRed Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like \"Bure\" \"Konstantinov\" and\\n\"Borshevshky\". Is this North America or isn\\'t it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec,\\nand Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other\\nteams is getting worse as well. \\n\\n    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about \"Pavel Bure, the\\nRussian Rocket\" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see\\nthe Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I\\'m not a\\nCanucks fan to begin with ;-). \\n\\n    Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that\\nI resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and\\nsome Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR\\nNORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren\\'t even\\nbetter hockey players. It\\'s all hype. This \"European mystique\" is sickening,\\nbut until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue\\nto have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.\\n\\n    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly\\nonly getting worse.\\n\\n    I\\'m all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures\\nand Selannes of the world play on their own continent.\\n\\n    I just don\\'t want them on mine.\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n-- \\nRichard J.

I posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia, and\\nI suppose that it might be useful here.  Note that I do not necessarily\\nagree or disagree with any of what follows: I present it as information.\\n\\n *\\n\\nFor a short summary:  a Southern Baptist named Larry Holly wrote a book\\nclaiming that Freemasonry is a religion incompatible with Christianity.\\n(Mr Holly\\'s father rejects Christianity, and Mr Holly blames that on the\\nMasons.)\\n\\nThe SBC\\'s Home Missions Board includes an interfaith witness department,\\nwhich studies other religions and how to teach them about Christ.  A few\\nyears ago, they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry: they concluded\\nthat it was not a religion, and therefore was outside their speciality.\\nHowever, Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry, and\\nlast year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study Masonry.  (I got the\\nfeeling that they were saying \"You got the wrong answer last time, try to\\ndo better and get the answer we want.\")\\n\\nAnyway, there\\'s been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions, but\\nthe dust has settled and the report is in.  Nobody is entirely happy with it,\\nbut everybody seems willing to live with it.  Both sides are saying things\\nsuch as: \"This was the best we were going to get in the current environment.\"\\n\\nThe report commends the Masons for the charity work they do, such as the\\nhospitals and burn centers they operate, as well as efforts to help the\\nelderly and prevent drug abuse.  The report acknowledges that many well-\\nknown Christians are and have been Masons, and notes that many teachings\\nof Masonry are \"supportive of Christian faith and practice\".  Examples of\\nthe latter include belief in God, emphases on honesty and integrity, and\\nthat some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian beliefs.\\n\\nOn the other hand, they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatible\\nwith Southern Baptist principles.  These included the use of titles which some\\npeople consider sacrilegious, the taking of certain oaths (even though they\\nare not meant seriously), the \"undeniably pagan and/or occultic\" writings of\\nsome Masonic leaders, the implication in some Masonic writings that salvation\\ncan be achieved by good works, and the racial discrimination practiced by many\\nMasonic lodges.  (I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a whole\\naren\\'t really in a place to speak on this last point.)\\n\\n\\nThe report concludes that Masonry is not a religion, and says that membership\\nshould not be endorsed or censured, but left to the discretion of individuals.\\nThis was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges,\\nand while one may include elements strongly against Christianity, another may\\nnot.  Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of\\nthe believer and the autonomy of the local church, and this history probably\\ninfluenced how the report came out.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThe information above was gleaned from \"The Religious Herald\", a publication\\nof the Baptist General Association of Virginia, and \"Baptists Today\", which\\ndoes not have any direct links to a religious organisation.  (Autonomy is a\\nbig issue among some Baptists.  8-)\\n\\nBecause I have neither the report itself, nor whatever Masonic documents are\\nrelevant to these issues, none of the above comes with a guarantee.

On ground where no monument yet\\nmarks countless sacrifices and unheralded achievements of Americans of all\\nraces and creeds in the building and defense of this nation, sits today a\\nmassive and costly edifice, devoted above all to a contentious and false\\nversion of the ordeal in Europe during World War II, of non-American\\nmembers of a minority, sectarian group.  Now, in the deceptive guise of\\ntolerance, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum begins a propaganda\\ncampaign, financed through the unwitting largess of the American taxpayer,\\nin the interests of Israel and its adherents in America.\\n\\n     How did the federal government allow the creation of such a\\nmonstrosity?  What is its meaning for American policy and for American\\nvalues?  And what must the American people do to regain control of the land\\ntheir servants in Washington handed over to a foreign interest and to\\nestablish an enterprise thereon, whether a museum or otherwise, informed by\\nand conducted according to American principles and interests?\\n\\n[Photograph captioned, \"The five-story, $150 million US Holocaust Memorial\\nMuseum in Washington, D.C. was built and is operated by a taxpayer-funded\\nfederal agency.  In the foreground is the museum\\'s six-sided \"Hall of\\nRemembrance.\"\\n\\n\\nORIGINS\\n\\n     In the late 1970s, during the presidency of James Earl \"Jimmy\" Carter,\\na propaganda campaign to promote the \"Holocaust,\" the alleged systematic\\nslaughter of some 6 million Jews by the Germans during World War II, was\\norganized and carried out from Hollywood and New York. As Benjamin Meed, an\\nimportant functionary of the council which controls the Holocaust museum,\\nwrote in 1990:\\n              \\n\\n          Almost a dozen years ago, a new phenomena [sic] developed.  The\\n     Holocaust was introduced into schools, colleges, and universities.\\n     Television broadcast programs on the Holocaust and millions of\\n     Americans watched them.  Soon, Americans took great interest in the\\n     lessons of the Holocaust, its uniqueness and its universal message.(1)\\n\\n\\n     Why the urgency of this campaign? Two factors were paramount:  first,\\nthe beginnings, more than three decades after the end of World War II, of\\nan objective scholarly assessment of the facts of the alleged German policy\\nto exterminate European Jewry.(2)\\n\\n     Second, the need to justify Zionist theory and practice in the face of\\nunprecedented international resistance to Israeli intransigence (including\\nthe famous UN General Assembly Resolution which equated Zionism with\\nracism), and to defend Israel\\'s aggressive policy under the leadership of\\nthe former terrorist, Prime Minister Menachem Begin.(3)\\n\\n\\nTHE U.S. HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL COUNCIL\\n\\n     In 1978 President Carter, his administration beleaguered at home and\\nabroad, succumbed to pressure from the new \"Holocaust\" lobby (and thus\\nAmerica\\'s influential Israel-first minority) by creating, through executive\\norder, the President\\'s Commission on the Holocaust.  Two years later, on\\nOctober 7, 1988, Congress passed--unanimously--a law establishing the\\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Council, charged principally with\\nconstructing and overseeing the operation of \"a permanent living memorial\\nto the victims of the holocaust\" and with providing \"for appropriate ways\\nfor the Nation to commemorate the Days of Remembrance, as an annual,\\nnational, civic commemoration of the Holocaust...\"(4)\\n\\n     A priceless tract of public land was turned over to the council, and,\\nafter years of costly delay (during which the U.S. Holocaust Memorial\\nCouncil\\'s budget swelled from $2.5 million to over $18 million a year), the\\nU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has been completed and readied for opening\\non April 22, 1993.\\n\\n\\nA SECTARIAN, ALIEN AGENDA\\n\\n     The Holocaust Memorial Council, besides soliciting tens of millions of\\ndollars in tax-deductible donations to finance the Holocaust museum, has\\nbusied itself with promoting an agenda of unalloyed support for minority,\\nZionist ends.\\n\\n     The membership of the council, a U.S. federal agency, has been\\noverwhelmingly Jewish since its founding in 1980.  The council\\'s two\\ndifferent chairmen--Elie Wiesel and Harvey Meyerhoff--have both been\\ncommitted to the support of the state of Israel, and the chairs of the\\ncouncil\\'s most important committees have been likewise Jewish and Zionist.\\n\\n     The chief fundraiser for the Holocaust museum, Miles Lerman, was\\nformerly American vice chairman for the State of Israel Bonds Organization,\\npromoting tax-free investment in a country which receives by far the\\nlargest amount of U.S. foreign aid per year.  Working the same wealthy\\nJewish Americans he has long dealt with in his fundraising for Israel,\\nLerman has helped raise nearly $160 million in tax-deductible\\ncontributions.  The biggest donors have been rewarded by having various\\ncomponents of the museum named for them, e.g. the Wexler Learning Center.\\n\\n     Nor is erecting and operating the Holocaust Memorial Museum the only\\nfunction with which the Holocaust Memorial Council has been charged.\\nAnother of its duties is to commemorate the Days of Remembrance for Victims\\nof the Holocaust, which Congress has raised to \"an annual, national, civic\\ncommemoration of the Holocaust.\"  Like the Israeli Yom Hashoah (Day of the\\nHolocaust), on which they are based, the Days of Remembrance are dated\\naccording to the lunar Hebrew calendar, and thus like Passover or Chanukah,\\nfluctuate from year to year. These foreign days of lamentation are\\ncurrently celebrated, under the flag of the republic, to prayers and chants\\nin Hebrew, in governmental settings from the Capital Rotunda to city halls,\\nacross the land.  Need it be stated that no group of American victims of\\npersecution, let alone another foreign group, enjoys any such federally\\nmandated and tax-supported day, or days, of recognition?\\n\\n\\nTHE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM\\'S ONE-SIDED \"HISTORY\"\\n\\n     Although the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council during its early years\\nmade noises about recognizing the ordeals of non-Jews during World War II,\\nby every indication from advance literature published by the council, the\\nU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is relentlessly Judeocentric.  While,\\naccording to a preliminary ground plan of the permanent exhibit, here and\\nthere are nods to non-Jewish groups oppressed by the German National\\nSocialists (never to groups victimized by Germany\\'s enemies, above all by\\nStalin\\'s USSR), the larger holocaust of World War II, which claimed an\\nestimated 75 to 80 million lives around the world, is ignored in preference\\nto the Jewish ordeal. Thus, to cite just one telling example, the museum\\'s\\n\"Life before the Holocaust\" exhibit refers strictly to *Jewish* life before\\nthe Holocaust.(5)\\n\\n     Where, in fact, non-Jews figure in the Museum, they figure largely as\\nvillains: the Germans and their allies and collaborators; the Western\\nAllies, including America, who refused to accept a large immigration before\\nthe war; the American political and military leaders who refused to\\nauthorize costly bombing raids on the Auschwitz \"gas chambers.\"\\n\\n        \\nRED LIBERATORS?\\n\\n     The museum\\'s message that support for Jews is the sole measure of\\ndecency during World War II leads to anomalies which, in an American museum\\nraised on ground hallowed to the principles of liberty on which this\\nrepublic is based, can only be called shocking.  That the victims of World\\nWar II atrocities by the Allies--massacres such as the fire-bombing of\\nTokyo and Dresden, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet\\nslaughter of their Polish prisoners at Katyn, the mass rapes carried out by\\nthe Red Army at the war\\'s end--receive no mention is deplorable.  But the\\nmuseum\\'s treatment of the armed forces which defended Stalin\\'s savage\\nSoviet tyranny is nothing short of grotesque.\\n\\n     In the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Communists appear only in the\\nguise of \"resistance fighters\" and \"liberators.\"  For example, the\\nsubmachine gun and false papers of Samuel Weissberg, a Communist Party\\nmember who rose to high rank in a Communist guerrilla group in North\\nFrance, are on honored display, no less precious a relic than the standard\\nheaps of shoes and hair, in the museum\\'s permanent exhibit.(6)\\n\\n     Even more unsettling is the honor given to Stalin\\'s notorious Red\\nArmy, which compiled a bloody and shameful record of atrocities across\\nEurope during, and after, the war.  As the U.S. Holocaust Memorial\\nCouncil\\'s newsletter fulsomely puts it, \"Flags will hang in the museum to\\nhonor the millions of Soviet soldiers who drove Nazi forces westward and\\nwho were the first Allied forces to liberate and publicize the existence of\\nthe camps.\"  In the words of Council chairman Harvey Meyerhoff, these\\nmartial banners of the Red tyranny have a single association: \"Much more\\nthan simply wartime memorabilia, these military artifacts are a significant\\ncontribution to memory, one that will remind future generations of the\\npivotal role Soviet forces played in defeating Nazism...\"(7)\\n\\n     What must the millions of Americans originating or descending from the\\nEuropean nations--Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,\\nPoland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, [former] Yugoslavia--\\nfor which the Red \"military artifacts\" symbolized invasion, tyranny,\\noppression and persecution of religion think as they see the fierce armies\\nof *their* persecutors hailed as \"liberators\"?\\n\\n\\nISRAEL IN THE MUSEUM\\n\\n     Just as one might guess from the circumstance that the museum\\'s\\ndirector, Yeshayahu Weinberg, and the head of its \"Learning Center,\"\\nYechiam Halevy, were brought in from Israel, the museum\\'s treatment of the\\nstate of Israel is adulatory.  An emotive tribute to the founding of Israel\\nis an integral part of the exhibition.  That the establishment of Israel,\\nand its expansion in subsequent wars, has meant colonial occupation and\\noppression for millions of the land\\'s native Palestinians, and\\ndispossession and exile for millions more, goes unmentioned--another\\ngrotesquery in an American museum supposed to instruct in the dangers of\\nintolerance and disregard of human rights.  As for the momentous\\ncollaboration between Hitler\\'s German state and the Jewish Agency in the\\n1930s, which through the Ha\\'avara Agreement enabled the transfer of vital\\ncapital and the influx of tens of thousands of highly skilled Jewish\\nimmigrants to Palestine, that is passed over in utter silence.(8)\\n\\n\\n\"HISTORICAL CORRECTNESS\"\\n\\n     The Holocaust Museum\\'s skewed history is not simply a matter of one-\\nsidedness and omission.  The museum has further committed itself to a fixed\\nand final interpretation of the surprisingly scanty and sometimes suspect\\nevidence for a German policy of annihilating European Jewry, largely in gas\\nchambers, in numbers approaching 6 million.  This despite a considerable\\nbody of research and scholarship that has arisen over the past two decades\\nin many lands, and which contests, by academic means, the substance of the\\nHolocaust \"extermination thesis.\"(9)\\n\\n     That the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council is aware of the work of the\\nrevisionists is clear: The council\\'s literature is replete, not with\\nsubstantive refutations of revisionist scholarship, but with slander and\\npolemic.  To cite one characteristic example, the _U.S. Holocaust Memorial\\nMuseum Newsletter_ of May, 1992 featured a front-page attack on Holocaust\\nrevisionism by Professor Deborah Lipstadt of Occidental College in which\\nthe author decried the revisionists for producing material that looked\\nscholarly, then lauded the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum as \"among the\\nmost efficacious ways\" of \"combating this pernicious trend,\" *while\\nneglecting to specify a single error of revisionist scholarship.*(10)\\n\\n     The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council recognizes that there is a\\nhistorical debate on the holocaust, but takes official notice of the\\ndissenting position only to attack it.  That an American institution,\\nsupported by the taxes of all Americans, should commit itself to inflexible\\nhistorical orthodoxy--in the service of a single American minority--is an\\nintolerable imposition on our First Amendment rights, as well as a mockery\\nof the Western, and American, ideal of objective scholarship.\\n\\n\\nA CENTER FOR EDUCATION?\\n\\n     U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council Chairman Harvey Meyerhoff has stated:\\n\"The museum is primarily an educational institution.\"(11)  From the\\ncouncil\\'s own literature, however, it is clear what Meyerhoff means by\\neducation.  The \"role-playing\" for children as well as adults who visit the\\nmuseum (visitors are to be issued \"identity cards\" bearing the name and\\nalleged fate of various Holocaust victims); the high-tech computer and\\nvideo effects and the recordings of speech and music which augment the\\nmuseum\\'s tendentiously described artifacts; and the museum\\'s goal, as\\nproclaimed by its Zionist fundraising chairman, Miles Lerman, of ensuring\\nthat \"Children in Dubuque, families in Tucson, and schoolteachers in\\nAtlanta will learn the history and the lessons of Auschwitz as thoroughly\\nas they learn the history of their own communities\"--all these show that\\nthe U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is a *propaganda* enterprise that seeks\\nto indoctrinate all Americans in a uniquely and partisanly Jewish (and\\nZionist) version of not merely the past, but the present and the\\nfuture.(12)\\n\\n\\nTHE AMERICAN RESPONSE\\n\\n     What is the American response to a partisan museum constructed in a\\nplace solemnly consecrated to the heroes and the values of our republic, to\\nbe lavishly operated with taxpayer dollars at a time when, even in our\\ncountry\\'s capital, thousands sleep homeless in the shadow of our national\\nmonuments?  What is the American response to an ambitious propaganda agenda\\nthat aims to impose a sectarian \"Holocaust remembrance\" in schools where\\nour children cannot pray, in town halls and federal buildings from which\\nthe religious symbols of the majority are banned in the name of freedom of\\nworship?\\n\\n     Over two centuries ago, Thomas Jefferson wrote: \"To compel a man to\\nfurnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he\\ndisbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.\"(13)\\n\\n     Nearly 150 years ago, Abraham Lincoln said: \"I insist that if there is\\n*anything* which it is the duty of the *whole people* to never entrust to\\nany hands but their own, that thing is the preservation and perpetuity of\\ntheir own liberties and institutions.\"(14)\\n\\n     The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the council which runs it, as\\nagencies of the government in which the American people is sovereign, must\\nbe removed from the special interest that now controls it.\\n\\n     The scope and purpose of the Museum must be expanded, from its present\\none-sided emphasis on foreign Jewish sufferings, real and imagined, in\\nEurope during the 1930s and 1940s to a compassionate yet realistic concern\\nfor *all* victims, but above all for *American* victims, of historic\\ninjustice.\\n\\n     The Museum must be made a place where Americans of every heritage, and\\nscholars of every viewpoint, may gather, educate, and be educated, without\\naccusation and in the absence of propaganda.  Until it is, the men and\\nwomen who founded and built and suffered and fought and died for America,\\nof every race, nationality and creed, will rest uneasy.\\n\\n\\nNOTES\\n\\n     1. _The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Newsletter_\\n(Washington, D.C.), August, 1990, \"Survivors Play Major Role in\\nEstablishing the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum,\" p.1.

Rather than being able to use different tools  \\ntogether in a flexible, interactive system, we find ourselves spending too  \\nmuch time converting between different data formats, writing throw-away  \\ntools and I/O parsers, and worrying about how to get to a particular goal  \\nrather than what it means to have attained it.\\n\\nWhat we need is an object-oriented scientific environment where the tools  \\nwe choose to use are integrated without being parts of a closed system,  \\nhighly interactive, and extendable (both by the addition of our own  \\nspecialized objects and by combining the available tools - graphically).   \\nThe use of such an environment should be a natural extension of our work,  \\nrequiring a very short learning phase and practically no  \\nuser-documentation.  The user should feel encouraged to explore different  \\npossibilities, testing his/her own scientific ideas without worrying too  \\nmuch about whether the system is able to cope (within reason, of course).   \\nBy building an open and object-oriented system, each user should be able  \\nto draw upon and combine those tools necessary or conducive to a  \\nparticular task: we all need to organize and archive our data, display  \\nresults, and combine information from many different sources.\\n\\nCurrently, the group consists of people from very different fields:  \\nMolecular Biology, Computer Science, Physics and Astronomy, and Geography.   \\nWhile many of our needs for such an environment diverge, the underlying  \\nmotivation is the same: no matter what you want to call it, we need a  \\nsystem which helps rather than hinders the organization of our scientific  \\ndata and daily work.\\n\\n\\nWhy NeXTSTEP?\\n\\nWhat else is there?  No other system offers the same power, a totally  \\nobject-oriented developers environment, UNIX-compatibility,  \\nhighly-interactive and standardized user-interface.  With the advent of  \\nNS486 and the expectation that NeXTSTEP will soon appear on a broad range  \\nof hardware platforms, such a system will soon be nearly universally  \\navailable.  Classical workstation vendors (SUN, IBM, HP, and the rest) now  \\nhave little to offer, no similar tools exist for the standard X-Windows  \\nGUI, if Apple had a system it would only run on their hardware, and the  \\nmass-market Windows/DOS world is a developer\\'s nightmare (either despite,  \\nor more probably because of, OLE).\\n\\nIn order to progress, we need an open discussion of how best to develop  \\nsuch an environment.  In NeXTSTEP parlance, do we simply have to put  \\ntogether a set of scientific protocols and a common API for our  \\n\"Hyper-knowledge\" servers? Should be use distributed objects?  What  \\nminimum set of tools do we need in order to start working with the  \\nenvironment?  What tool-needs do we all have in common and which ones are  \\nbest developed by specialized sub-groups?  How many already existing tools  \\ncan/should be integrated into the system (e.g. Mathematica)?  Do we need  \\nan \"AVS\"-like tool for data-flow manipulation?\\n\\n\\nMailing list and Anonymous ftp\\n\\nIn order to take part to the project or to push the discussion forewords,  \\nyou are invited to subscribe to: sci-tools@embl-heidelberg.de\\nAll (interesting) suggestions, projects and sources will be archive and  \\nsoon available (anonymous ftp).\\nFor questions send mail to sci-tools-help@embl-heidelberg.de\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nThe European Molecular Biology Laboratory (Heidelberg, Germany) has  \\nconsented to provide the computer resources for a mailing list and  \\nanonymous ftp services.\\n\\nRick Hessman    <hessman@eden.uni-sw.gwdg.de>\\nGeorg Tuparev   <tuparev@embl-heidelberg.de>\\n',\n",

First you discuss your non-existent literature\\ntastes, then your fantasies, and now your choices of historical revisionism.\\nAre you related to \\'Arromdians\\' of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and\\nRevisionism Triangle?\\n\\nThe Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term \\'Turks,\\' \\nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \\nto \\'Muslims.\\' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \\nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \\nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \\nTurkish minority. The \\'Pomaks\\' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \\nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \\nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \\naccording to the agreements? \\n\\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \\nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \\nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\\nin 1980 the \\'democratic\\' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \\ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\\n\\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \\nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \\nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \\nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the \\'so-called\\' \\nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \\nof historical monuments. \\n\\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \\nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \\nHellenizing the region.\\n\\nThe longstanding use of the adjective \\'Turkish\\' in titles\\nand on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts have\\nordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers\\' Association, \\nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \\nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \\nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\\nthe word \\'Turkish\\' on their buildings and on their official\\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \\nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\\n\\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \\nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \\nfindings were published in a report titled \\n\\n \\'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.\\'\\n\\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \\nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \\nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \\nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \\nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \\nLausanne Convention. \\n\\n|1|\\n\\nHELSINKI WATCH: \"PROBLEMS OF TURKS IN WESTERN THRACE CONTINUE\"\\n\\nAnkara (A.A)  In a 15-page report  of the \"Helsinki Watch\"  it is\\nstated that the Turkish minority in Western Thrace is still faced\\nwith problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being\\nimplemented by the Greek Government be brought to an end.\\n\\nThe report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government\\nshould grant  social and political  rights to all the  members of\\nminorities that are equal to  those enjoyed by Greek citizens and\\nin addition  they must  recognize the  existence of  the \"Turkish\\nMinority\" in Western Thrace and  grant them the right to identify\\nthemselves as \\'Turks\\'.\\n\\nNEWSPOT, May 1992\\n\\n|2|\\n\\nGREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKS\\n\\nThe  Xanthi independent  MP Ahmet  Faikoglu said  that the  Greek\\nstate is trying to cut all  contacts and relations of the Turkish\\nminority with Turkey.\\n\\nPointing out that while the  Greek minority living in Istanbul is\\ncalled \"Greek\"  by ethnic  definition, only  the religion  of the\\nminority in  Western Thrace is  considered. In an  interview with\\nthe Greek  newspaper \"Ethnos\" he said:  \"I am a Greek  citizen of\\nTurkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in Western\\nTrace are also Turkish.\"\\n\\nEmphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority in\\nWestern  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreement\\nsigned in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey\\nin Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace.\\n\\nRecalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr.\\nSadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority,\\nFaikoglu said.  \"In fact we  helped Greece. Because  we prevented\\nGreece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European\\ncountries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal\\nrights.\"\\n\\nOn Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are\\npredestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical\\nreasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign\\npowers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by\\ncooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was\\nwill to improve relations with Greece.\\n\\nNEWSPOT, January 1993\\n\\n|3|\\n\\nMACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.\\n\\nTwo ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in\\nAthens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a\\nCourt Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.\\n\\n  Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis)\\nhave been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in\\nan Athenian magazine.\\n\\n  Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly\\nmagazine  \"ENA\"  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as\\nMacedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would\\nfield  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek\\ngeneral election.\\n\\n  Bulev said in the interview: \"I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.\"\\nSideropoulos said  in the  article that \"Greece  should recognise\\nMacedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations\\nagainst  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the\\nborder, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC\\nare falling.\"\\n\\n  The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court\\nsummons,  was   that  \"they  have   spread...intentionally  false\\ninformation  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the\\ncitizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the\\ninternational interests of the country (Greece).\"\\n\\n  The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a\\nMacedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to\\n1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely\\nconcentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state\\nif anyone declares themselves Macedonian.\\n\\n  In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned\\nMacedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian\\nvillages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in\\n1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5\\nmillion Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000\\nin Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.\\n\\n  Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian\\nhuman rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a\\nfew years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in\\nthe mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced\\nthe Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of\\nFlorina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the\\nmajority of ethnic Macedonians live.\\n\\n  Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in\\nwhich  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent,\\nespecially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its\\nnorthern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.\\n\\n  Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned\\nGreece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who\\nlargely live in Western Thrace).
